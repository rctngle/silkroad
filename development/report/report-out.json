{"chapter_1":{"title":"1. Executive Summary","content":"<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim peoples living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and persecution. In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses against these peoples. An objective of the government’s campaign is to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and cultural erasure, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment and forced assimilation. More than a million men and women – Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, Tajiks, and Hui– have been arbitrarily detained in what the government refers to as “vocational training centres” or “transformation through education” centres, but which are more accurately described as internment camps. In these camps, detainees are subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.</p><p>The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour of ethnic minorities outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, peaceful assembly, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.</p><p>The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up it abuses in Xinjiang and, in particular, to prevent foreigners from obtaining information about the internment camps. The whereabouts of many of the people sent to internment camps is not known. Many remain in indefinite incommunicado detention in the camps. Hundreds of thousands have been transferred to situations of forced labour or given long prison sentences. Those who have been permitted to return to their homes do so under strict conditions limiting their movement and associations.</p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign – and the associated cover-up – derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic monitories is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert – along with a substantial portion of the civilian population who have been terrorized into complicity – to conduct the surveillance, enforce illegal policies, and administer the internment camps, prisons, and forced labour. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their basic human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.</p><p>This report details human rights violations committed by the Government of China in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2021. The findings are based primarily on first-hand testimonial evidence from XX survivors and witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International, XX of whom had never shared their stories publicly before. The report also draws on leaked government documents and a substantial body of public reporting by journalists and other investigators. Evidence demonstrates that the Government of China knowingly and purposefully targeted ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including by unlawful restriction of their basic human rights, as well as by an ethnically targeted campaign of mass detention, and torture and other ill treatment. The government’s actions evince a clear intent to target certain populations collectively on the basis of their ethnicity and religion and to use serious violence and intimidation to outlaw their religious practices and eradicate their ethno-cultural identify. On the basis of the evidence gathered by Amnesty International and from other sources that Amnesty has concluded to be credible, this report concludes that the Government of China has committed serious violations of international human rights law and international criminal law, including crimes against humanity.</p><p>The report has 12 chapters:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Chapter 2 describes the research methodology and details the obstacles to conducting human rights research in Xinjiang.</p></li>\n<li><p>Chapter 3 provides background information Xinjiang and gives an overview of the cycles of violence, discrimination, and repression that occurred in Xinjiang from the 1980s to 2016.</p></li>\n<li><p>Chapter 4 describes major human rights violations in Xinjiang since 2017 that have occurred outside the camps, including the severe restrictions on freedom of religion, freedom of movement, and privacy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Chapter 5 focuses on what happens to detainees from the time they are detained until they enter an internment camp: the process of arbitrary detention, interrogation, biometric data collection, and transfer to a camp.</p></li>\n<li><p>Chapter 6 details life for detainees inside the internment camps, including the conditions in the camps, the highly regimented daily routines, and the content of the “re-education” curriculum.

Methodology","content":"<p>This report is a product of field and remote research carried out between October 2019 and April 2021. The report’s findings and conclusions draw heavily from first-hand testimonies that Amnesty International gathered from survivors and witnesses, as well as an analysis of satellite imagery and data. The report also draws on testimonial evidence and confidential government documents gathered from journalists, diaspora groups, and other human rights organizations.</p><p>Between October 2019 and April 2021, Amnesty International interviewed XXX people with knowledge of the situation in Xinjiang, China: XX (XX men and XX women) were survivors of internment camps, XX had lived in or visited Xinjiang since 2017, X had worked in the internment camp system, XX were family members of detainees.</p><p>These testimonies represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation in Xinjiang since 2017. According to the Shahit database – a website that aggregates and synthesizes all publicly available testimony related to the Xinjiang internment camps – excluding the survivors interviewed in this report, only XX camp survivors have ever spoken publicly.<a href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a> XX of the XX survivors and witnesses interviewed for this report had never shared their story publicly before, and XX had never shared a significant portion of their story.</p><p>Amnesty informed interviewees about the nature and purpose of the research and about how the information they provided would be used. Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of two days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz; a few were conducted in English. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey and remotely in XX other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with survivors and witnesses were conducted individually.</p><p>For reasons related to the security of the potential interviewees, no interviews were conducted in Xinjiang either in person or remotely. The Government of China threatens, detainees, tortures, and “disappears” individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Many survivors and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken with Amnesty International. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee’s name and/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee’s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases.</strong></em></p><p>Moreover, since only a small number of internment camp survivors (likely a few hundred) are believed to have left China, and because the government likely knows the identify of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very conservative approach to including any information that could be identifying. For example, none of the testimony in this report is associated with a specific internment camp where an interviewee was detained or with a specific village or town where an interviewee lived, and only rarely with a specific age or occupation of the interviewee.</p>","sections":{"section_1":{"title":"2.1 Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in Xinjiang","content":"<p>The Government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China – particularly internment camp survivors – have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in Xinjiang. The possibility of speaking from Xinjiang over a genuinely secure form of communication is remote and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are under heavy surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Anyone living in Xinjiang who does speak out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, or is accused of speaking out risks arrest, detention, imprisonment, torture, and disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.</p><p>The risks are even more severe for ex-detainees and their families, who already face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-internees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Every internment camp survivor who spoke with Amnesty signed a document that forbid them from speaking with anybody – especially journalists and foreigners – about what they experienced in the camp. The document reportedly specifies that if they violate this prohibition they will be interned again, along with members of their family (see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p><p>As a result of the obstacles and risks facing people in Xinjiang, with few exceptions the vast majority of credible testimonial evidence about the situation has been gathered from survivors and witnesses who have left Xinjiang and spoken from abroad. Speaking from abroad is also difficult and comes with serious risks, especially for family members of the person speaking who remain in China. Since at least 2017, obtaining permission to travel abroad – and, in many cases, domestically – has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs, and extraordinarily difficult for other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Members of ethnic minority groups who have obtained permission to travel abroad since 2017 appear to require a connection to a foreign country (usually citizenship or immediate family) and one or more “guarantors” in Xinjiang who agree, in writing, that they will be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing speaks or shares information about the internment camps or does not return to China on time. As documented in this report and elsewhere, these are not empty threats: family members of people who speak about the issue from abroad have been sent to internment camps and in some cases disappeared (see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p><p>Independent journalists and human rights investigators have all been denied unfettered access to the region. A few have entered disguised as tourists but have found it nearly impossible to speak safely with people about the internment camps.<a href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>2</sup></a> Those who have travelled to the region officially have encountered a coordinated effort by government officials to block them from speaking with survivors and witnesses and from accessing internment camps, except in situations where the government tries to exercise complete control over where they visit, who they speak with, and what is said to them.<a href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>Reporting about the situation from abroad also carries significant risk. In several instances, when journalists with family in Xinjiang have reported on or spoken about the situation in Xinjiang from abroad, family members have been arrested, sent to a camp or prison, or disappeared.<a href=\"#fn4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>Chinese government officials have also made a concerted effort to disseminate misinformation and disinformation, both to foreigners and to the local population, about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Several internment camp survivors told Amnesty International that they were forced to give false statements to their families or to the media, both while interned and after they had been released.<a href=\"#fn5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>5</sup></a> Several survivors told Amnesty that while they were detained they had been coached about what to say to foreign journalists or Chinese government delegations that visited their camp.<a href=\"#fn6\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>6</sup></a> [Pseudonym Q1], told Amnesty how he was trained to speak with journalists who were expected to come to the camp he was in:</p><p><strong>“One day they told us journalists were coming. And that when you see them to smile. And to say what you were told or you will be taken to an underground room [where people are tortured] … [During the days before the journalists were scheduled to arrive] our Chinese language classes stopped. And we practised answering questions for journalists, for more than 10 days… we practised saying that the food is good and the Chinese Communist Party is great. I don’t know if the journalists ever came because we were not allowed to go out. I heard they came, but I didn’t see them.”</strong><a href=\"#fn7\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref7\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>[Pseudonym X2], who spent more than a year in multiple internment camps, told Amnesty that she was part of group that was coached for 20 days about what to say to visiting journalists. “[We were coached] to say that we are studying well, deepening our knowledge, and we are thankful to the state, are getting a salary, that our family is taken care of, that we are here for the daytime only, and here voluntarily,” she said.<a href=\"#fn8\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref8\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>8</sup></a> None of this was true.</p><p>In 2019, leaked government documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), <em>The New York Times</em>, and other media outlets and scholars appear to have triggered attempts to put even tighter controls on information coming out of Xinjiang, including through the physical destruction of documents related to the internment camp system.<a href=\"#fn9\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>9</sup></a> Amnesty International received several account of government cadres being made to burn files related to the internment camp system in the aftermath of the leaks.<a href=\"#fn10\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>10</sup></a> One camp survivor – a former government cadre – told Amnesty that he participated in burning files. “I attended the burning. It was in… 2019, after I was released… I was helping to carry the files…It was not only the [detainees’] files. It is any re-education related materials. For example, all notes from meetings… it took five or six days to burn everything [in the office],” he said.<a href=\"#fn11\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>The government’s attempts to silence the affected population and destroy the evidence echo a directive from one of the leaked government documents – known as the “Telegram” – obtained by the ICIJ, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining “strict secrecy” with respect to everything that happens inside camps.<a href=\"#fn12\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>12</sup></a> While the leaked portion of the directive lacks significant details about how the secrecy will be maintained beyond the statement that “[i]t is necessary to strengthen the [internment camps’] staff’s awareness of staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline,” the experiences of survivors and witnesses documented in this report and elsewhere illustrate the immense resources that have been devoted to this cover-up effort, as well as the often violent methods used ensure the silence of the civilian population.</p>"}}},"chapter_3":{"title":"3. Background","content":"<p>The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is in the far northwest of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). A huge area – 1.66&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup> – it encompasses approximately one-sixth of China’s landmass and is bordered by eight countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Afghanistan.<a href=\"#fn13\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>13</sup></a> The area comprises vast semi-desert steppes in the north and severe desert basins ringed by historic oasis towns in the south.</p><p>The XUAR is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. According to China’s 2010 census the region had a population of approximately 22 million. More than half of the region’s population belongs to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million), Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and other populations whose languages, cultures, and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han, who are the majority in “interior” China.</p><p>The area covered by the XUAR was renowned over centuries for the ancient Silk Road and its flourishing conduit of trade and culture between China and the rest of the world. Rich in coal, natural gas, and oil, the XUAR is intertwined with many of China’s economic, strategic, and foreign policy goals. China’s leaders now consider stability in the XUAR vital to the success of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, a massive global infrastructure development programme aimed at strengthening China’s links to Central Asia and beyond.</p><p>The XUAR is one of the five autonomous regions of the PRC, where the officially recognized “national minorities” are granted some formal representation in the organs of regional government. The autonomy conferred to these regions by the PRC Constitution and Law on Regional Autonomy has remained largely symbolic. In the XUAR, as in the rest of the PRC, all major policy decisions are taken by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><p>The Government of China considers the XUAR to have been an inseparable part of China for millennia. But this history is disputed by many, particularly Uyghurs, who often perceive China as a colonizing force and aspire to independence. Aspirations towards independence have their roots in both the distant past and recent history. During the 1930s and 1940s, two independent Republics of Eastern Turkestan were formed successively in Kashgar (1933) and Ili (1944) as attempts to resist Chinese rule.<a href=\"#fn14\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref14\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>14</sup></a> Both republics were short-lived, but they have continued to inspire nationalist opposition since 1949, particularly among Uyghurs. Over the years, various opposition groups militating for Eastern Turkestan’s independence were formed clandestinely in the XUAR. Some of these groups have resorted to violence (see below).</p><p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. In 1949, the local Turkic population, in majority Uyghur, accounted for at least 93% of the region’s population, while ethnic Chinese in the region amounted to about 6 or 7% of the population. According to official statistics, Han Chinese now make up approximately 40% of the population. With the massive influx of Han Chinese, the indigenous population has felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land.<a href=\"#fn15\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>During the first three decades of the PRC, resettlement of Han Chinese into the XUAR was facilitated by what is now called the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (commonly known as the Bingtuan), an institution established in the early 1950s. The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize Xinjiang, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of the XUAR, separating the north, where most Kazakhs in Xinjiang live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from the XUAR regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons.<a href=\"#fn16\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>16</sup></a></p>","sections":{"section_1":{"title":"3.1 Cycles of discrimination, violence and repression from the 1980s to 2016","content":"<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim peoples living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and persecution by their government, including with respect to their freedom of movement and freedom of religion and cultural practice as well as access to employment, education, and health care. This historical discrimination lessened with the “open door” policy launched in the late 1970s and the subsequent economic reforms, which catalyzed a religious revival in the XUAR as in the rest of the PRC. The authorities allowed the reopening of mosques, many Muslims were allowed again to travel to Islamic countries, and contacts with Muslims abroad were encouraged.<a href=\"#fn17\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>The emergence of independent Central Asian states with the breakup of the Soviet Union, protracted conflicts in other neighbouring countries, fears that Islam might provide a rallying point for ethnic nationalism, and concerns that Islamist movements abroad might inspire young Uyghurs who had gone to study in foreign Islamic schools all appear to have heightened the Chinese authorities’ fears of organized political opposition in the XUAR, leading to a reversal of the relatively liberal policies implemented during the 1980s. Since the late 1980s, the return to restrictive policies and other factors have generated growing ethnic discontent in the XUAR. The continuing influx of Han Chinese migrants, discrimination, unequal economic opportunities, curbs on religious and cultural rights, and enforcement of the government’s birth control policy are among the factors fuelling unrest. The increasing interethnic tensions have led to cycles of sporadic violence and heavy-handed repression</p><p>These fears were reinforced by incidents of violence during the mid-1990s.<a href=\"#fn18\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref18\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>18</sup></a> At that time, the government closed many mosques and Qur’anic schools, stopped the use of Arabic script, imposed tight controls on the Islamic clergy, and dismissed or arrested religious leaders deemed to be too independent or “subversive”. Muslims working in government offices and other official institutions were prohibited from practising their religion under threat of losing their jobs. In 1996, the government intensified its campaign against “national separatists”, “religious extremists”, and “illegal religious activities”, launching at the same time an “in-depth atheist education” campaign to purge grassroots Communist Party committees and other institutions of Muslim believers.</p><p>In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the start of the “Global War on Terror”, restrictions on Muslims increased as China began to classify Uyghur dissidents as terrorists and to pressure the rest of the world to designate Uyghur separatist groups as terrorist organizations.<a href=\"#fn19\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref19\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>19</sup></a> The authorities cultivated informants to report on the content of sermons in an attempt to monitor imams and prevent mosques from being used to disseminate separatist ideas or extremist religious thought. The government carried out “ethnic unity education” campaigns during religious festivals,<a href=\"#fn20\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>20</sup></a> and specifically targeted the celebration of Ramadan, with authorities forbidding fasting by students and government employees.<a href=\"#fn21\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref21\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>21</sup></a> Religious education was strictly prohibited for minors, who were also banned from entering mosques.<a href=\"#fn22\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref22\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>22</sup></a> The authorities also outlawed private religious instruction outside the auspices of officially sanctioned religious organizations.<a href=\"#fn23\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref23\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>23</sup></a></p><p>Policies of repression grew further in the aftermath of several incidents of violence that occurred between 2009 and 2013, including the riots in Ürümqi that erupted on 5 July 2009. According to official counts, the rioting left nearly 200 dead and at least 1,700 injured, with most of the casualties reported to be Han.<a href=\"#fn24\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref24\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>24</sup></a> Many hundreds of Uyghurs were detained as police made house-to-house sweeps following the riots, and swift justice was handed down to those alleged to be responsible for the violence. The courts handed down numerous death sentences and heavy prison terms.<a href=\"#fn25\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref25\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>25</sup></a> Dozens of other detainees are reported to have been victims of enforced “disappearances”, being held by authorities without any notification to family members.<a href=\"#fn26\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref26\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>26</sup></a></p><p>In addition to repressive criminal-justice measures, other measures that fall under the broad category of “social management” were designed to prevent instability in the first place. These included an increase in the number of police in Xinjiang: 8,000 officers were hired with the goal of establishing a police presence in more rural parts of the region.<a href=\"#fn27\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref27\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>27</sup></a></p><p>Campaigns aimed at further restricting religious practice and equating such practice with “extremism” expanded.

Serious Human Rights Violations Outside of Internment Camps since 2017","content":"<p>In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the Government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses of Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. While the government had severely restricted the human rights of ethnic minorities for decades (see Chapter 3 above), the new restrictions were dramatically more severe than anything imposed previously. An objective of the government’s campaign is to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and cultural erasure, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment. More than a million men and women have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps (see Chapter X). The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation and forced assimilation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.</p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign – and the associated cover-up – derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minority groups is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert – along with a substantial portion of the civilian population who have been terrorized into complicity – to conduct the surveillance and enforce illegal policies. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of arrest, detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their basic human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.</p>","sections":{"section_1":{"title":"4.1.1 Witness accounts of restrictions on freedom of religion and cultural practice.

Torture and Other Ill-Treatment in Internment Camps","content":"<p>Every camp survivor Amnesty International interviewed was tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (in this report referred to as “torture and other ill-treatment”) during their internment. Torture and other ill-treatment are constitutive elements of life in the internment camps.</p><p>The torture and other ill-treatment that detainees experience in the camps fall into two broad categories. The first category includes the physical and non-physical (that is, mental or psychological) torture and other ill-treatment experienced by <em>all</em> detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps. This includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native tongue, living under the constant threat of violence, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. The camps are designed to ensure that these types of torture and other ill-treatment are an inescapable aspect of daily life for every detainee.</p><p>The second category includes physical torture and ill-treatment that occurs during interrogations or as punishment for misbehaviour. This type of treatment commonly includes beatings, electric shocks, solitary confinement, deprivation of food and water, exposure to cold, and the prolonged use of restraints, such as tiger chairs.</p><p>The instances of torture and other ill-treatment documented below (and in Chapter 5) are violations of international law.

She described being taken by two female guards to a small, dark, cold, and windowless room in the basement of the camp, where she was handcuffed and shackled and made to sit on an iron chair for three days:</p><p><strong>“Two women took me to the room.

[Pseudonym X8], a farmer, described to Amnesty how he was tortured multiple times in two camps during his time in detention – both during an interrogation and during multiple punishment sessions. He described his interrogation session:</p><p><strong>“That day two guards came to my cell. They said I would be interrogated. I stuck my hands out through the hole in the wall [door] and they cuffed me [from the other side of the door]… [I could hear] the guards talking on the walkie-talkie saying that ‘Guobao is waiting’… Two guards took me from the cell and dropped me off [at the room where I was interrogated]. Two men were inside. They locked the door from inside. The guards were in uniform but the plainclothes [Guobao officers] interrogated me… They started asking about personal information, ethnicity, date of birth, when I went to Kazakhstan, my occupation… [they asked] ‘did you pray there? What do your parents do?’ I said I only stayed with family, that I took care of livestock, and that I didn’t do anything illegal… they asked me about mosque and praying… If I told them I had been praying, I had heard that I would get sentenced for 20 or 25 years. So I told them I never prayed. Then they became upset. They said, ‘All that time with livestock, you became an animal too!’ Then they hit me with a chair until it broke… I was sitting on a chair and they hit me with another chair. They hit me until the chair broke. I fell to the floor. I almost fainted… Then they put me on the chair again. They said, ‘this guy hasn’t changed yet, he needs to stay [in the camp] longer’… then they walkied the guards, who helped me back to the cell.”</strong></p><p>[Pseudonym X8] was also sent to two punishment rooms on multiple occasions for trivial offenses.</p><p><strong>“[The first time I was taken in the first camp] it was because I tried to look out the window. There was a window with a bar [in my cell]. We were not allowed to look outside… [The first time I was sent in the second camp] was because they made me the responsible person for the cell. Leaders were inspecting the cell. When they came in [to inspect our cell] we had to stand up and show respect but my cell didn’t do it so I was sent to punishment room… [The second time I was sent to the punishment room in the second camp] was one day before I was released. It was because I didn’t sit still in the classroom.”</strong></p><p>[Pseudonym X8] was tortured in both camps. He told Amnesty he was repeatedly electrocuted while being asked repetitively whether he “would do it again”. “[I had to say that] ‘I made a mistake but will not do it again,” he said. “The first time they electric shocked me. Then they tied me up on a chair for 24 hours without food or water… The second time they chained me up [from the wall].” He told Amnesty he was left immobilized on a tiger chair multiple times, and the room was very cold. “They would open the window on winter days,” he said.</p><p>[Pseudonym X8] also described two of the punishment rooms, one of which had 20 tiger chairs.</p><p><strong>“You can see the chair across from you, but not beside you because there are [wooden] dividers [that go to the ceiling] … Above every tiger chair there is a camera and microphone and a small white light. The light is on the ceiling. Lights are dim… There is a window but no light. The window is close to the ceiling. It is very narrow… Everything was white. The walls, floors, ceilings. All new… It is in the basement where we live… There were several other people [in the room] but I could not see [most of] them. There was one guy in front of me. I could see him. The other guy [in front of me] was punished for using his Kazakh mother tongue… We talked to each other. We had to talk in Chinese.”</strong></p><p>[Pseudonym 65] also described being punished and sent to a place with numerous tiger chairs – in this case they were located in a corridor of a building in the camp:</p><p><strong>“I was punished once. … In class I raised my hand and asked a question then [the teacher] threw a plastic ruler at me and said ‘why do you speak!’ … then [the teacher] said to the guards to take me to the tiger chair. … They tied my hands and legs to the chair. … I was lucky [because I wasn’t there for too long] … There were 10-15 chairs. … It wasn’t a real room; it was part of a corridor. … There were partitions between the chairs, like in a public toilet. You could not see the chair beside you. … There was another person in front of me [who I could see] … When the guard left I asked the man in front of me how long he had been there. He said 24 hours.”</strong></p><p>Confinement in tiger chairs is also often a form of solitary confinement, as the person immobilized in the chair is often left alone for hours. One survivor stated that the camps she was interned in had a “dark” room, which was a windowless room without light, about two metres by one metre, where detainees were sent if they misbehaved. She told Amnesty how she was put in the room for two days:</p><p><strong>“On that day a 70-year-old lady spoke her mother tongue, Uyghur, in our cell. … The guards wanted to take her to a tiger chair. I argued with them and said put me in the tiger chair. … They said that I hadn’t learned and still had extremist thoughts, so they put me in the dark room. … It’s just a room for one person.

There is also significant debate about whether the decision to release at least some of the detainees was a consequence of a sea change in government policy or a result of what should be considered normal turnover for detainees who had already spent considerable time in the camps and fulfilled the criteria for being released (see below).</p><p>It is also plausible that many of the detainees were released as a consequence of a policy change with respect to one ethnic minority group only: ethnic Kazakhs. Testimonial evidence from survivors’ family members suggests that a significant portion of the ethnic Kazakh population detained in the camps has been released, particularly those with Kazakh citizenship or family ties to Kazakhstan.<a href=\"#fn442\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref442\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>442</sup></a> This is likely the result of effective pressure on the Government of Kazakhstan by civil-society groups in Kazakhstan to pressure the Government of China to release some ethnic Kazakh detainees.<a href=\"#fn443\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref443\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>443</sup></a></p><p>The release of certain detainees notwithstanding, camp survivors, family members of detainees, journalists, and scholars have argued that the government’s broad claims are false.<a href=\"#fn444\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref444\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>444</sup></a> Credible evidence suggests the internment camp system is still operating and that many people – perhaps just as many as ever – remain detained in camps or in some other form of indefinite incommunicado detention, either in prisons or situations of forced residential labour. No survivors who were present in the camps after the government’s announcement in December 2019 have spoken publicly. But testimony gathered by Amnesty International and other organizations from survivors released before the government’s announcement and from friends and family of detainees indicates that many detainees remain in the camps and that many others have been sent to prisons or situations of forced labour (for more on forced labour see Chapter&nbsp;8 below).<a href=\"#fn445\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref445\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>445</sup></a></p><p>Moreover, scholars analyzing both the available testimonies from camp survivors and family members and public court documents have argued that while the government did begin to dismantle some of the internment camps and release some of the detainees as a result of international pressure, the situation of many detainees had gotten worse because they had been given long sentences and were transferred from camps to prisons.<a href=\"#fn446\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref446\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>446</sup></a></p><p>The Chinese government’s own statistics support the contention that the prison system in Xinjiang has grown significantly since 2017. Journalists at <em>The New York Times</em>, relying entirely on government statistics, demonstrated that incarceration rates in Xinjiang increased dramatically in 2017 and 2018, with hundreds of thousands more people being sent to prisons than average, a 10- to 20-fold increase from previous years.<a href=\"#fn447\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref447\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>447</sup></a> The data reportedly includes prison sentences and “other criminal punishments, which can include suspended sentences or house detention.” It is not known if these numbers include people who were sent to camps and then transferred to prisons or only people sentenced and sent directly to prisons. Moreover, according to another report based on government statistics, in 2017 there was a dramatic increase in the number of lengthy sentences handed down by courts in Xinjiang. Before 2017, prison sentences longer than five years accounted for approximately 11% of the total number of people sentenced. In 2017, 87% of sentences were more than five years.<a href=\"#fn448\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref448\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>448</sup></a> Since <em>The New York Times</em> investigation, the government has not released any more data on incarceration rates.</p><p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) – a think tank that monitors and analyzes the situation in Xinjiang – has gathered satellite imagery that it argues shows that, while some camps have been dismantled, the internment camp system not only continued to operate after the government’s 2019 announcement but, in fact, grew substantially.<a href=\"#fn449\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref449\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>449</sup></a> ASPI identified more than 380 sites that it contends were newly built or expanded since 2017, including internment camps, detention centres, and prisons.

Then, in the absence of any new issues flagged by IJOP, the case is reported “up level-by-level” to three different groups of government cadres, the last of which is the “prefecture (state, city) vocational skills education and training service bureau” that, in concert with “comrades of the local committee”, makes the final determination about whether or not to release the detainee.</p><p>If the detainee is designated ready for release, the group that does the final evaluation also determines whether the detainee enters a “skills improvement class” for “intensive training” prior to being released.<a href=\"#fn455\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref455\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>455</sup></a></p>"},"section_3":{"title":"8.1.2 Family involvement in the release process","content":"<p>The decision to release a detainee is based in part on the behaviour of the detainee’s family, which is also being monitored, evaluated, and incorporated into the detainee’s score.

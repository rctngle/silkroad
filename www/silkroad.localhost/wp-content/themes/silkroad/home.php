						<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Turkic Muslim peoples living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in China have long faced government-directed discrimination and persecution. In 2017, under the guise of a campaign to counter the ‘three evil forces’ of terrorism, extremism, and separatism, the government commenced a massive escalation of it abuses against these peoples. The campaign’s actual objectives are to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices, and to replace these with other secular, state-sanctioned, views and activities, and ultimately to ‘transform’ members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p>
						<p>To achieve this cultural erasure and political indoctrination, the government enacted far-reaching policies that violate the fundamental human rights and commenced a campaign of mass-arrest, mass-incarceration, and torture. More than a million men and women – Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, Tajiks, and Dungans – have been arbitrarily arrested, denied due process, and unlawfully interned in so-called ‘re-education camps’ (that is, internment camps), where they were subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.</p>

He worries that Erkin cannot access treatment for his heart problems and diabetes. Erkin’s brother, now living in Norway, has lost contact with his family members in Xinjiang, and the Chinese authorities have so far not provided any official documents on Erkin’s alleged crimes. 
Erkin’s brother believes Erkin is in prison because Erkin kept in contact after the brother moved abroad. In his last video call before being detained, Erkin asked his brother to stop writing about Uyghur matters to avoid being detained and putting the whole family at risk. Erkin’s brother was recently told that Erkin’s daughter, Mihriay, was detained in an internment camp where she died in December 2020.","Erkin likes reading, writing and gardening. Before becoming a government official, he used to volunteer in a government disease prevention department in Xinjiang by helping doctors communicate with people who do not speak Mandarin.

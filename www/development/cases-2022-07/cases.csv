SR137,Abdulshukür Ablez ,,Accountant,1982,,Uyghur,Kashgar city,Unknown,Travelling to Turkey,2015,Unknown,Internment camp or in prison,"Abdulshukür had just graduated and found a job as an accountant before he went missing. Between 2019 and 2020, through a connection in Kashgar, Abdulshukür’s brother found out that Abdulshukür had been arrested, after being detained a first time for two years, possibly in an internment camp. 
The Chinese authorities have shared no details or official documentation with Abdulshukür’s brother, who now lives in Turkey. Abdulshukür’s brother has lost contact with his family in China, and therefore cannot confirm whether the rest of the family has received official information either. However, he told Amnesty International that he believes Abdulshukür was arrested for having travelled to Turkey, back in 2015, and having stayed there for 20 days to visit the country. That was the last time the two brothers saw and heard from each other.","Abdulshukür is married and has two children who, according to Abdulshukür’s brother, are with their mother in Urumqi. Abdulshukür graduated from Xinjiang Agriculture University, before finding a job as an accountant in a bakery company. 
It is believed that another of Abdulshukür’s brothers, [Ablet Ablez](#case-SR129), is also being detained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SR138,Parizat Abdugul,,Housewife,13 November 1965,,Uyghur,Turpan city ,"""Involved in terrorist activities""",Religious practices ,May-June 2016,Unknown,Prison ,"The last time Parizat spoke with her son-in-law, who now lives in Turkey, was before March 2016, over a video call. During that call she sounded fine but also worried because “things were getting worse for Uyghurs in Xinjiang.” According to the son-in-law Amnesty International interviewed, her house was one of those that were searched at nights. 
Between May and June 2016, through some connections in her hometown, Parizat’s son-in-law discovered that Parizat was sent to prison. Through them and a video posted on social media by a news channel based in Bejing, he later found out that she was accused of being “involved in terrorist activities”. However, Parizat’s son-in-law believes that the real reason for her arrest is related to her religious practices. He added: “It’s impossible. She's a single widow woman who stayed at home most of the time, she has very few friends. How could she become a terrorist? I never imagined they [the Chinese authorities] can say she committed such a crime.”
Afterwards, Parizat’s son-in-law tried unsuccessfully to gather more information about her arrest through family members and friends in Xinjiang. None of his requests for information submitted to the Chinese authorities have received a response.","Parizat is a housewife from Turpan city. She is described by her son-in-law as a very shy person, with very few friends, who spent most her time at home. 
It is believed that a brother of Parizat’s son-in-law, [Parhat Rasul](#case-SR096), is also  in prison serving  a 9-year sentence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that call, he told her that “the weather is getting worse,” eluding to the situation in Xinjiang. According to Qalisbek’s sister, interviewed by Amnesty International and who now lives in Kazhakistan, Qalisbek was arrested and sent to a prison in Urumqi, with a 5-year sentence, in December 2019. Qalisbek had been detained once before, at the end of July 2018, but released after a couple of months.
The official reasons for the imprisonment are unknown, but Qalisbek’s sister heard from a trusted source that her brother is being punished because he posted online videos of himself reading poems about Kazakhstan, back in 2010. 
According to Qalisbek’s sister, Qalisbek’s wife – who had been also detained for one year between 2018 and 2019 – is allowed to talk to her husband once every two months. Phone calls are dialled from a police station in Sanji (Changji), and Qalisbek’s wife is monitored while she speaks with her husband.
Qalisbek’s sister has been unable to gather any further information on her brother’s situation, despite her appeals to the Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan.","Qalisbek is an ethnic Kazakh, who was a musician, composer, and music teacher before being detained. He loves music and helping his community. He is married and has a 6-year-old daughter. He has suffered from health conditions affecting his lungs and liver  since his first detention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

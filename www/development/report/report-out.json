{"chapter_1":{"type":"introduction","title":"Executive Summary","content":"<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Muslim peoples living in The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) have long faced discrimination and persecution. In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses against these peoples. An objective of the government’s current campaign appears to be to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and forced assimilation, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment and forced assimilation. It is estimated that more than a million men and women – Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, Tajiks, and Hui – have been arbitrarily detained in what the government refers to as “vocational training” or “transformation through education” centres, but which are more accurately described as internment camps. In these camps, detainees are subjected to a ceaseless forced indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.</p><p>The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation in XUAR. The government has enacted far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour of ethnic minorities outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, peaceful assembly, opinion, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in XUAR for millions of members of ethnic minorities.</p><p>The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up it abuses in XUAR and, in particular, to prevent anyone living outside of XUAR from obtaining information about the internment camps. The whereabouts of many of the people sent to internment camps is not known. Many remain in indefinite detention in the camps. Hundreds of thousands have reportedly been transferred to situations of forced labour or given long prison sentences. Those who have been permitted to return to their homes do so under strict conditions limiting their movement and associations.</p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign – and the associated cover-up – derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minorities is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert – along with a substantial portion of the rest of the population who have been terrorized into compliance – to conduct the surveillance, enforce illegal policies, and administer the internment camps, prisons, and forced labour. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.</p><p>This report details human rights violations committed by the Government of China in XUAR between 2017 and 2021. This report is a product of field and remote research carried out between October 2019 and April 2021. The report’s findings and conclusions draw heavily from first-hand testimonial evidence from 70 survivors and witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International, 55 of whom had never shared their stories publicly before. These testimonies represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation in XUAR since 2017. <em><strong>As a result of security concerns, nearly all survivor and witness interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee’s name and/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee’s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases.</strong></em></p><p>The report also draws on an analysis of satellite imagery, as well as leaked government documents and a substantial body of public reporting by journalists and other investigators. Evidence demonstrates that the Government of China knowingly and purposefully targeted ethnic minorities in XUAR, including by unlawful restriction of their basic human rights, as well as by an ethnically targeted campaign of mass detention, and torture and other ill treatment. The government’s actions evince a clear intent to target certain populations collectively on the basis of their ethnicity and religion and to use severe violence and intimidation to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p><p>On the basis of the evidence gathered by Amnesty International and from other sources that Amnesty has concluded to be credible, this report concludes that the Government of China has committed serious violations of international human rights law and international criminal law, including the crimes against humanity of persecution, imprisonment and torture.</p><p>The report has 12 chapters. Chapter 1 provides background information on XUAR and gives an overview of the cycles of violence, discrimination, and repression that occurred in XUAR from the 1980s to 2016. Chapter 2 describes major human rights violations in XUAR since 2017 that have occurred outside the camps, including the severe restrictions on freedom of religion, freedom of movement, freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Chapter 3 focuses on what happens to detainees from the time they are detained until they enter an internment camp: the process of arbitrary detention, interrogation, biometric data collection, and transfer to a camp. Chapter 4 details life for detainees inside the internment camps, including the conditions in the camps, the highly regimented daily routines, and the content of the “re-education” curriculum. Chapter 5 describes the widespread and systematic use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in the internment camps. Chapter 7 examines the process that determines whether detainees are released from internment camps. Chapter 8 describes certain aspects of the process that detainees go through if they are given prison sentences while in the camp. Chapter 8 describes the experiences of a few camp survivors who were transferred to from the camp to situations of forced labour. Chapter 9 describes the restrictions on the rights and freedoms placed on ex-internees and their families after internees are released from the camps, including the surveillance by government minders, who often live with ex-detainees; other restrictions on movement and association; continued “re-education” classes; and social ostracization. Chapter 10 argues that the abuses committed in XUAR since 2017 meet all the elements of the elements of at least three crimes against humanity under international criminal law: persecution, imprisonment, and torture. Chapter 11 concludes argues that the international community must take action to investigate the situation in XUAR, most importantly, to prevent the crimes against humanity and other human right violations from continuing. Chapter 12 provides recommendations to the Government of China and UN bodies and member states</p>","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"Methodology","content":"<p>This report is a product of field and remote research carried out between October 2019 and April 2021.

[[[See ‘XUAR Victims Database’, https://shahit.biz/eng/#filter, which tracks all publicly-available testimonial evidence related to the internment camps.

Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of two days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Mandarin, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz; a few were conducted in English. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey and remotely in XX other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with survivors and witnesses were conducted individually.</p><p>For reasons related to the security of the potential interviewees, no interviews were conducted in XUAR either in person or remotely. The government of China threatens, detains, tortures, and forcibly disappears individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in XUAR. Many survivors and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken with Amnesty International. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee’s name and/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee’s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases.</strong></em></p><p>Moreover, since only a small number of internment camp survivors (likely a few hundred) are believed to have left China, and because the government likely knows the identity of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very conservative approach to including any information that could be identifying. For example, none of the testimony in this report is associated with a specific internment camp where an interviewee was detained or with a specific village or town where an interviewee had lived, and only rarely with a specific age or occupation of the interviewee. </p>"},"section_2":{"type":"section","title":"Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in XUAR","content":"<p>The Government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in XUAR from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China – particularly internment camp survivors – have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in XUAR. The possibility of communication from XUAR over a genuinely secure form of communication is remote and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of ethnic minority groups in XUAR are under heavy surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Anyone living in XUAR who does speak out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, or is accused of speaking out risks arrest, detention, imprisonment, torture, and enforced disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.</p><p>The risks are even more severe for ex-detainees and their families, who already face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-internees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Every internment camp survivor who spoke with Amnesty had, prior to being released, been made signed a document that forbid them from speaking with anybody – especially journalists and foreigners – about what they experienced in the camp. The document reportedly specifies that if they violate this prohibition they will be interned again, along with members of their family (see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p><p>As a result of the obstacles and risks facing people in XUAR, with few exceptions the vast majority of credible testimonial evidence about the situation has been gathered from survivors and witnesses who have left XUAR and spoken from abroad. Speaking from abroad is also difficult and comes with serious risks, especially for family members of the person speaking who remain in China. [[[See https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/02/china-uyghurs-abroad-living-in-fear/]]] Since at least 2017, obtaining permission to travel abroad – and, in many cases, domestically – has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs, and extraordinarily difficult for other Muslim ethnic minorities in XUAR. Members of ethnic minority groups who have obtained permission to travel abroad since 2017 appear to require a connection to a foreign country (usually citizenship or immediate family) and one or more “guarantors” in XUAR who agree, in writing, that they will be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing speaks or shares information about the internment camps or does not return to China on time. As documented in this report and elsewhere, these are not empty threats: family members of people who speak about the issue from abroad have been sent to internment camps and in some cases disappeared (see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p><p>Independent journalists, human rights investigators, and diplomats have all been denied unfettered access to the region. A few journalists have entered disguised as tourists but have found it nearly impossible to speak safely with people about the internment camps. [[[Cite PBS and Vice]]] Those who have travelled to the region officially have encountered a coordinated effort by government officials to block them from speaking with survivors and witnesses and from accessing internment camps, except in situations where the government tries to exercise complete control over where they visit, what they see, who they speak with, and what is said to them. [[[Cite Channel 4, BBC, etc]]]</p><p>Reporting about the situation from abroad also carries significant risk. In several instances, when journalists with family in XUAR have reported on or spoken about the situation in XUAR from abroad, family members have been arrested, sent to a camp or prison, or disappeared. [[[Add in examples from RFA and others, and from our campaign “cases”]]]</p><p>Chinese government officials have also made a concerted effort to disseminate misinformation, both to foreigners and to the local population, about the human rights situation in XUAR. Internment camp survivors told Amnesty International that they were forced to give false statements to their families or to the media, both while interned and after they had been released. [[[CITE AI EXAMPLES OF SURVIVORS BEING FORCED TO GIVE FALSE STATEMENTS: B2, Z1, etc; And other examples:]]] Survivors told Amnesty that while they were detained they had been coached about what to say to foreign journalists or Chinese government delegations that visited their camp. [[[CITE AI EXAMPLES OF SURVIVORS BEING COACHED: Q1, I2, y2 – made to sing and dance; And other examples:]]] [Pseudonym 13], told Amnesty how he was trained to speak with journalists who were expected to come to the camp he was in:</p><blockquote><strong>“One day they told us journalists were coming. And that when you see them to smile. And to say what you were told or you will be taken to an underground room [where people are tortured] … [During the days before the journalists were scheduled to arrive] our Chinese language classes stopped. And we practised answering questions for journalists, for more than 10 days… we practised saying that the food is good and the Chinese Communist Party is great. I don’t know if the journalists ever came because we were not allowed to go out. I heard they came, but I didn’t see them.”</strong> [[[13]]]</blockquote><p>[Pseudonym 36], who spent more than a year in multiple internment camps, told Amnesty that she was part of group that was coached for 20 days about what to say to visiting journalists. “[We were coached] to say that we are studying well, deepening our knowledge, and we are thankful to the state, are getting a salary, that our family is taken care of, that we are here for the daytime only, and here voluntarily,” she said. [[[36]]] None of this was true.</p><p>In 2019, leaked government documents were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), <em>The New York Times</em>, and other media outlets and scholars (see text box X). These leaks appear to have triggered attempts to put even tighter controls on information coming out of XUAR, including through the physical destruction of documents related to the internment camp system. Amnesty International received several account of government cadres being made to burn files related to the internment camp system in the aftermath of the leaks. [[[9, 43]]] One camp survivor – a former government cadre – told Amnesty that he participated in burning files. “I attended the burning. It was in… 2019, after I was released… I was helping to carry the files…It was not only the [detainees’] files. It is any re-education related materials. For example, all notes from meetings… it took five or six days to burn everything [in the office],” he said. [[[G2]]]</p><p>The government’s attempts to silence the affected population and destroy the evidence echo a directive from one of the leaked government documents – known as the “Telegram” – obtained by the ICIJ, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining “strict secrecy” with respect to everything that happens inside camps.

A huge area – 1.66&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup> – it encompasses approximately one-sixth of China’s landmass and is bordered by eight countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Afghanistan. The area comprises vast semi-desert steppes in the north and desert basins ringed by historic oasis towns in the south.</p><p>The XUAR is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. According to China’s 2010 census the region had a population of approximately 22 million. More than half of the region’s population belongs to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million), Hui, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and other populations whose languages, cultures, and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han, who are the majority in “interior” China.</p><p>The area covered by the XUAR was renowned over centuries for the ancient Silk Road and its flourishing conduit of trade and culture between China and the rest of the world. Rich in coal, natural gas, and oil, the XUAR is intertwined with many of China’s economic, strategic, and foreign policy goals. China’s leaders now consider stability in the XUAR vital to the success of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, a massive global infrastructure development programme aimed at strengthening China’s links to Central Asia and beyond. [[[https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/21/china-belt-and-road-projects-should-respect-rights#]]]</p><p>The XUAR is one of the five autonomous regions of the PRC, where the officially recognized “national minorities” are granted some formal representation in the organs of regional government. The autonomy conferred to these regions by the PRC constitution and the Law on Regional Autonomy has remained largely symbolic. In the XUAR, as in the rest of the PRC, all major policy decisions are taken by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><p>The Government of China considers the XUAR to have been an inseparable part of China for millennia. But this history is disputed by many, particularly Uyghurs, who often perceive China as a colonizing force and aspire to independence. [[[See: James A. Millward, “Eurasian Crossroad: A History of Xinjiang,” Columbia University Press, New York, 2007.]]] Aspirations towards independence have their roots in both the distant past and recent history. During the 1930s and 1940s, two independent Republics of Eastern Turkestan were formed successively in Kashgar (1933) and Ili (1944) as attempts to resist Chinese rule. [[[See Linda Benson, “The Ili Rebellion: The Moslem Challenge to Chinese Authority in XUAR, 1944-1949\", M.E. Sharpe, New York, 1990; and Dru C. Gladney, “Internal colonialism and the Uyghur nationality: Chinese nationalism and its subaltern subject”, in CEMOTI (Cahiers d’Etudes sur la Mediterranee Orientale et le monde Turco-Iranien), No.25, janvier-juin 1998, pp.47-61.]]] Both republics were short-lived, but they have continued to inspire nationalist opposition since 1949, particularly among some Uyghurs. Over the years, various opposition groups calling for “Eastern Turkestan’s” independence were formed clandestinely in the XUAR. Some of these groups have resorted to violence (see below).</p><p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. In 1949, the local Turkic population, in majority Uyghur, accounted for at least 93% of the region’s population, while ethnic Chinese in the region amounted to about 6 or 7% of the population. According to official statistics, Han Chinese now make up approximately 40% of the population. With the massive influx of Han Chinese, ethnic minority groups have felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land. [[[See Lillian Craig Harris, “XUAR, Central Asia and the Implications for China’s Policy in the Islamic World”, in The China Quarterly, No.133, March 1993, pp.111-129, and Nicholas Becquelin, “Trouble on the Marches”, in China Perspectives No.10, March/April 1997, pp.19-28.]]]</p><p>During the first three decades of the PRC, resettlement of Han Chinese into the XUAR was facilitated by what is now called the XUAR Production and Construction Corps (commonly known as the Bingtuan), an institution established in the early 1950s. The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize XUAR, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of the XUAR, separating the north, where most Kazakhs in XUAR live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from the XUAR regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons. [[[See “New Ghosts Old Ghosts – Prisons and Labor Reform Camps in China”, by James D. Seymour and Richard Anderson, M.E. Sharpe, 1998, p.45. Chapter 3 of the book includes detailed information about the Bingtuan and its network of labour camps and prisons, as well as the separate penal establishments under the Department of Justice of the XUAR regional government. 7 During the 1990s, the Bingtuan has been placed directly under the authority of the central government in Beijing and has been granted privileges giving it the same status as the XUAR regional government (see South China Morning Post, 17 April 1997, and Ming Pao, 28 August 1998).]]]</p>","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"Cycles of discrimination, violence and repression from the 1980s to 2016","content":"<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim groups living in XUAR have long faced discrimination and repression by their government, including with respect to their human rights to freedom of movement, freedom of religion and [enjoyment of their] culture as well as access to employment, education, and health care. This historical discrimination lessened with the “open door” policy launched in the late 1970s and the subsequent economic reforms, which catalyzed a religious revival in the XUAR as in the rest of the PRC in the 1980s. The authorities allowed the reopening of mosques, many Muslims were allowed again to travel to Islamic countries, and contacts with Muslims abroad were encouraged. [[[See Lillian Craig Harris, op.cit., p. 121, and Gaye Christoflersen, “XUAR and the Great Islamic Circle: The Impact of Transnational Forces on Chinese Regional Planning”, The China Quarterly, No.133, March 1993, pp.130-151.]]]</p><p>The emergence of independent Central Asian states with the breakup of the Soviet Union, protracted conflicts in other neighbouring countries, fears that Islam might provide a rallying point for ethnic nationalism, and concerns that Islamist movements abroad might inspire young Uyghurs who had gone to study in foreign Islamic schools all appear to have heightened the Chinese authorities’ fears of organized political opposition in the XUAR. This lead to a reversal of the relatively liberal policies implemented during the 1980s. Since the late 1980s, the return to restrictive policies and other factors have generated growing ethnic discontent in the XUAR.</p><p>The continuing influx of Han Chinese internal migrants, discrimination, unequal economic opportunities, curbs on religious and cultural rights, and enforcement of the government’s birth control policy are among the factors fuelling unrest. The increasing interethnic tensions have led to cycles of sporadic violence and heavy-handed repression.</p><p>These fears were reinforced by incidents of violence during the mid-1990s. [[[See https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/144000/asa170181999en.pdf]]] At that time, the government closed many mosques and Qur’anic schools, stopped the use of Arabic script, imposed tight controls on the Islamic clergy, and dismissed or arrested religious leaders deemed to be too independent or “subversive”. Muslims working in government offices and other official institutions were prohibited from practising their religion under threat of losing their jobs. In 1996, the government intensified its campaign against “national separatists”, “religious extremists”, and “illegal religious activities”, launching at the same time an “in-depth atheist education” campaign to purge grassroots Communist Party committees and other institutions of Muslim believers.</p><p>In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States of America and the start of the “Global War on Terror”, restrictions on Muslims increased as China began to classify Uyghur dissidents as terrorists and to pressure the rest of the world to designate Uyghur separatist groups as terrorist organizations.

While the government had severely restricted the human rights of ethnic minorities for decades (see Chapter X), the new limitations were dramatically more severe than anything imposed previously. An objective of the government’s current campaign appears to be to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p><p>To achieve this forced political indoctrination and cultural assimilation, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment. It has been estimated that more than a million men and women have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps (see Chapters X – X). The internment camp system is one part of a larger campaign of subjugation and forced assimilation of ethnic minorities in XUAR. The government has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour outside the camps. These policies violate multiple human rights, including to security and liberty of person, and to privacy; the freedoms of movement, opinion, expression, thought, conscience, and religion and belief; and to equality before the law and non-discrimination. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in XUAR for millions of members of ethnic minorities.</p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign – and the associated cover-up – derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize large portions of the region’s population to help enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minority groups is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert – along with a substantial portion of the population who have been forced to assist – to conduct the surveillance and enforce right-violating policies. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear.

[[[UNIFORMCOLOURS: 35 (had this color,said blue in second interview); 5 (has Chinese characters); 16 (said orange, not yellow) + ADD]]] A detainee’s classification can be adjusted in accordance with their “performance and point situation [that is, their score]”. [[[https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm]]] According to government documents, being in the normal management group is a necessary condition for being released from the camp (for more on criteria for release see Chapter X).</p><p>The exact reasons why specific internees are placed in different categories are not well understood by survivors; however, there is a general belief that detainees who were arrested for reasons related to religion are more likely to be placed in the two stricter categories. [[[RELIGION + STRICT: +ADD]]] According to survivors, the normal management group was for “ordinary” crimes, such as having prohibited software on your phone; strict management was for “crimes” related to religion; and very strict management was for imams and for people who had previously been convicted of “serious crimes.” [[[EXAMPLESOF PEOPLE WHO ARE INSTRICTER CATEGORIES: 19, 7, 27 (taught in camp)]]] Some survivors believe the classification system is, at least in part, based on a detainee’s ethnicity, because Uyghurs in their camps were much more likely to be placed in one of the stricter categories. [[[UYGHURS MORE LIKELY IN STRICT: + ADD]]]</p><p>The type of treatment detainees are subjected to in the camp corresponds to the classifications. Survivors stated that they observed detainees from the different classification being treated differently. [[[DIFFERENT TREATMENT: 41 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 5], a detainee who also worked in the camp for part of the time she was interned, described some of the differences she observed with respect to the treatment of detainees, especially related to their ability to move around the camp and to communicate with family members.</p><blockquote><strong>“Most of the people in the strict management group are there for being religious clerics or somehow involved with religion… I know this because interrogations [</strong>f<strong>or detainees] sometime took place in staff room where [I spent time] … [In the camp I worked in,] the normal management group learned Chinese and were allowed to walk in the yard, the strict [management] [are allowed to] sit on their beds [some of the time], the very strict learn in their cell, are not allowed to move, and never get fresh air. … The normal group gets to make a call once a week and strict group once every two weeks and visits once a month… The very strict group is not permitted to have visitors.”</strong> [[[5 (check)]]]</blockquote><p>With two possible exceptions, the survivors Amnesty interviewed were in the normal management category when they arrived in the camp. [[[44 (check); 19 (Uyghur)]]] As a result, nearly all the conclusions made in this report – like nearly all the testimonial evidence gathered about the camps from journalists and other organizations – come from evidence provided by survivors who experienced only the normal management treatment. However, given the second-hand accounts about the two stricter categories – which are observations made by survivors and staff who were in the same camps as internees in the stricter categories – it stands to reason that detainees in the stricter categories are treated much more severely and are much less likely to have been released from a camp and instead remain detained or have been transferred to prison (see below chapter Y).

The prohibition, enshrined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, has become a rule of customary international law, which is binding on states even if they have not ratified the relevant human rights treaties. It is also a peremptory norm, a <em>jus cogens</em> rule, with no reservations or derogations permitted. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), pp. 54-61.]]] It is not enough to simply prohibit and criminalize torture and, where appropriate, other acts of ill-treatment under national law; states must take a range of measures to protect people and prevent these forms of abuse.

Articles 1 of The CAT defines torture as “any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

[[[cecke]]]</p><p>Unlike torture, “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” has not been defined in international treaties. This phrase originated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and was incorporated unchanged into CAT. In approaching the question of what distinguishes such ill-treatment from torture, Amnesty International is guided by the principle that “[t]he term ‘cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses”. Amnesty International considers, in line with much of the jurisprudence of international and regional human rights monitoring bodies, that cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may generally be described negatively in relation to torture, that is, as ill-treatment which “do[es] not amount to torture” because it lacks one or more of the key elements of the torture definition described above. An act, or instance, of ill-treatment would therefore constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment rather than torture either if it lacks the required intention, the required purpose (or discrimination), or if the pain or suffering it causes is not considered to be “severe”.

[[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), pp. 84 – 88.]]] Force should be used in law enforcement only when strictly necessary, that the use of force should not be disproportionate to the legitimate objective to be achieved.

[[[9 CAT Concluding Observations: USA, UN Doc.CAT/C/USA/CO/2 (2006) §24]]] Blindfolding and hooding should also be prohibited, as should prolonged sleep deprivation, threats (including threats of torture and death threats), using cold air to chill the detainee, electrocution, and beating.

A/56/156 (2001) §39(f); CPT Standards, 12th General Report, CPT/Inf (2002) 15 §38]]] Other forms of coercion include interrogation techniques designed to offend personal, cultural, or religious sensitivities. [[[UN Mechanisms Joint Report on detainees at Guantánamo Bay, UN Doc. E/CN.4/2006/120 (2006) §60.]]] Prolonged incommunicado detention and secret detention violate the prohibition against torture or other ill-treatment and are therefore forms of prohibited coercion. [[[2 UN Mechanisms Joint Study on secret detention, UN Doc. A/HRC/13/42 (2010), §§27-28, 292(f)]]] Other techniques that may violate the rights of detainees include withholding clothing or hygiene products, permanently keeping lights on in the cell, and sensory deprivation. [[[Asencios Lindo et al v Peru (11.182),]]]</p><p>The revised UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) provide that instruments of restraint should be used only as strictly necessary to prevent risk of harm to individuals or others, and they are not to be used for punishment.

[[[Rule 33 of the Standard Minimum Rules]]] Permitted instruments and methods of restraint may be used only when necessary and proportionate; they must not be applied for longer than strictly necessary and must never be used as a punishment. [[[Principle 5 of the Principles of Medical Ethics, Rules 33-34 of the Standard Minimum Rules]]] It is essential that detainees are kept in conditions that ensure their physical and mental wellbeing. They should not be kept in overcrowded conditions or subjected to extremes of heat or cold. They must have access to natural light and fresh air. [[[Rules 13, 14 and 23 of the Mandela Rules; CPT Standards, CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2015, p. 25, §30. (https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/175)]]] Detainees must have access to exercise, recreational, religious and other facilities. In particular, detainees must be able to have access to the open air daily if weather permits. [[[Rules 12-23 and 58-66 of the Mandela Rules.]]] Rule 44 of the Mandela Rules defines solitary confinement as “the confinement of prisoners for 22&nbsp;hours or more a day without meaningful human contact”. International standards and experts increasingly favour restriction or even elimination of solitary confinement, in particular as a punishment. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), Chapter 4.5.5.]]] Depending on the specific reason for its application, conditions, length, effects and other circumstances, solitary confinement can constitute torture or other ill-treatment. [[[Special Rapporteur on torture report, UN Doc. A/66/268 (2011) §80.]]]</p><p>According to Article 7(2) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the crime against humanity of torture is “the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions”, committed within the context of the widespread or systematic attack directed at the civilian population as part of a governmental or organisational policy. Unlike torture as defined in the CAT, there is no purposive requirement that the ill-treatment be committed for, “such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.” Further there is no requirement that the ill-treatment be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.” In addition the Rome Statute does not explicitly differentiate between torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment as does CAT. The ill-treatment that would constitute the crime against humanity of torture when committed within the contextual elements must therefore be understood to be more broadly defined than under CAT. However, the ICC has clarified that, “although there is no definition of the severity threshold as a legal requirement of the crime of torture, it is constantly accepted in applicable treaties and jurisprudence that an important degree of pain and suffering has to be reached in order for a criminal act to amount to an opact of torture.” [[[Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute ICC-01/05-01/08 15 June 2009 para 193]]] In reaching this conclusion the Court relied on the definition of torture from CAT, implying that the standard of severity that it would apply would be similar to that applicable under CAT. In any case the ICC will not judge the severity of each incident of ill-treatment, instead it will consider the cumulative effect of a course of conduct. [[[Prosecutor v.

The Committee Against Torture (CAT), the expert UN body charged with overseeing the treaty’s implementation, has repeatedly raised concerns about a number of issues in China including: the lack of a definition of torture in domestic laws that accords with that of UNCAT; exclusion at trial of evidence obtained through torture and other ill-treatment; arbitrary detention where there is a high probability of torture and other ill-treatment; torture and other ill-treatment of human rights defenders; and the lack of independence of judges and lawyers.

The first time was for making his bed too early in the morning. The second time, he was taken along with the rest of his cellmates, who were punished collectively because one member of the cell had spoken in Kazakh.</p><blockquote><strong>“[The first time I was taken I was on ‘night duty’ with an old Hui man. It was morning. We thought it was time to start making the beds. Then, on the loudspeaker, someone said it wasn’t time to start making the beds. Then [two guards] came into the room and took [the two of us who were on duty] to the [punishment] room. The room had eight [tiger] chairs. We were there for maybe five hours. We did not have water. There was no food. And no toilet. They opened the window. It was very cold. We stayed strapped in chair. The chair is metal, and we were cuffed with arms straight out. Our legs were cuffed… The second time, there was a guy [in my cell] who spoke in Kazakh. And the guards asked him if he spoke in Kazakh. And he said ‘no’. And then they took [everyone in the cell] to the tiger chair.”</strong> [[[12]]]</blockquote><p>[Pseudonym 29], an older woman who spent a year in the camp without ever being given a firm reason for her arrest – although she believes it was because she had gone to Kazakhstan – was taken to a punishment room because she had argued with a cellmate after trying to come to the defence of another woman who was hard of hearing and was being verbally abused. She described being taken by two female guards to a small, dark, cold, and windowless room in the basement of the camp, where she was handcuffed and shackled and made to sit on an iron chair for days:</p><blockquote><strong>“Two women took me to the room. They held me under my arms. They told me to sit on an iron chair… [They] cuffed my arms and legs… My hands were cuffed to each other, not to the chair... [I was taken because] there was a woman [in my cell] who couldn’t hear well. And there was another Uyghur woman [in the cell] who used to call her names. I said [to the Uyghur woman], ‘why are you taking advantage of her? You shouldn’t do that!’ [Then an argument started.] Then the guards came [in the cell] and asked us what happened and they took me to this room… It was a dark room. No toilet in it. Just a bucket… There was no bed, just a chair. They brought one piece of bread and water. I was getting pretty cold. I started shouting that I was getting cold… My hands and legs were cuffed [to the chair] … They told me I would be there for five days. [But] the following day they took my cuffs off and brought food. And [the guard] watched through the door and told me to eat. But I was cold and couldn’t eat… I was there for three days.”</strong> [[[29]]]</blockquote><p>Detainees told Amnesty International they were sent to punishment rooms multiple times. [Pseudonym 37], a farmer, described to Amnesty how he was tortured multiple times in two camps during his time in detention – both during an interrogation and during multiple punishment sessions. He described his interrogation session:</p><blockquote><strong>“That day two guards came to my cell. They said I would be interrogated. I stuck my hands out through the hole in the wall [door] and they cuffed me [from the other side of the door] … [I could hear] the guards talking on the walkie-talkie saying that ‘Guobao is waiting’… Two guards took me from the cell and dropped me off [at the room where I was interrogated]. Two men were inside. They locked the door from inside. The guards were in uniform but the plainclothes [Guobao officers] interrogated me… They started asking about personal information, ethnicity, date of birth, when I went to Kazakhstan, my occupation… [they asked] ‘Did you pray there? What do your parents do?’ I said I only stayed with family, that I took care of livestock, and that I didn’t do anything illegal… they asked me about mosque and praying… If I told them I had been praying, I had heard that I would get sentenced for 20 or 25 years. So I told them I never prayed. Then they became upset. They said, ‘All that time with livestock, you became an animal too!’ Then they hit me with a chair until it broke… I was sitting on a chair and they hit me with another chair. They hit me until the chair broke. I fell to the floor. I almost fainted… Then they put me on the chair again. They said, ‘this guy hasn’t changed yet, he needs to stay [in the camp] longer’… then they walkied the guards, who helped me back to the cell.”</strong> [[[37]]]</blockquote><p>[Pseudonym 37] was also sent to two punishment rooms on multiple occasions for trivial offenses.</p><blockquote><strong>“[The first time I was taken in the first camp] it was because I tried to look out the window. There was a window with a bar [in my cell]. We were not allowed to look outside… [The first time I was sent in the second camp] was because they made me the responsible person for the cell. Leaders were inspecting the cell. When they came in [to inspect our cell] we had to stand up and show respect but my cell didn’t do it so I was sent to punishment room… [The second time I was sent to the punishment room in the second camp] was one day before I was released. It was because I didn’t sit still in the classroom.”</strong></blockquote><p>[Pseudonym 37] was tortured in both camps. He told Amnesty he was repeatedly electrocuted while being asked repetitively whether he “would do it again”. “[I had to say that] ‘I made a mistake but will not do it again,” he said. “The first time they electric shocked me. Then they tied me up on a chair for 24 hours without food or water… The second time they chained me up [from the wall].” He told Amnesty he was left immobilized on a tiger chair multiple times, and the room was very cold. “They would open the window on winter days,” he said. [[[37]]]</p><p>[Pseudonym 37] also described two of the punishment rooms, one of which had 20 tiger chairs.</p><blockquote><strong>“You can see the chair across from you, but not beside you because there are [wooden] dividers [that go to the ceiling] … Above every tiger chair there is a camera and microphone and a small white light. The light is on the ceiling. Lights are dim… There is a window but no light. The window is close to the ceiling. It is very narrow… Everything was white. The walls, floors, ceilings. All new… It is in the basement where we live… There were several other people [in the room] but I could not see [most of] them. There was one guy in front of me. I could see him. The other guy [in front of me] was punished for using his Kazakh mother tongue… We talked to each other. We had to talk in Chinese.”</strong> [[[37]]]</blockquote><p>[Pseudonym 65] also described being punished and sent to a place with numerous tiger chairs – in this case they were in a corridor of a building in the camp:</p><blockquote><strong>“I was punished once. … In class I raised my hand and asked a question then [the teacher] threw a plastic ruler at me and said, ‘why do you speak!’ … then [the teacher] said to the guards to take me to the tiger chair. … They tied my hands and legs to the chair. … I was lucky [because I wasn’t there for too long] … There were 10-15 chairs. … It wasn’t a real room; it was part of a corridor. … There were partitions between the chairs, like in a public toilet. You could not see the chair beside you. … There was another person in front of me [who I could see] … When the guard left, I asked the man in front of me how long he had been there. He said 24 hours.”</strong> [[[65]]]</blockquote><p>Solitary confirmed was utilized in the camp as a form of punished. Confinement in tiger chairs is also sometimes a form of solitary confinement<strong>,</strong> as the person immobilized in the chair is left alone for close to a day or longer. One survivor stated that the camp she was interned in had a “dark”, coffin-like room, which was a windowless room without light, about two metres by one metre, where detainees were sent if they misbehaved. She told Amnesty how she was put in the room for two days:</p><blockquote><strong>“On that day a 70-year-old lady spoke her mother tongue, Uyghur, in our cell. … The guards wanted to take her to a tiger chair. I argued with them. … They said that I hadn’t learned and still had extremist thoughts, so they put me in the dark room. … It’s just a room for one person. I was just lying on the floor. … When you lie down [with your head at one end] your feet almost touch the wall. … There is a toilet in the room, nothing else.”</strong> [[[66]]]</blockquote><p>Physical ill-treatment also takes place throughout the camps outside of interrogation and “formal” punishments, most commonly through beatings, the use of restraints, and the use of pepper spray. Guards routinely beat detainees who misbehave, even for the most trivial offences. Amnesty International interviewed XX people who reported being beaten during detention. [[[BEATINGS: 37, 17, 18 (interviewed before), 14, 16, 35, 17, 7, 28 (f), 27 (f) + ADD]]] Electric batons were often used to electrocute people and to beat people with. [[[ELECTRIC BATONS: 28 + ADD]]]</p><p>[Pseudonym C2] told Amnesty how he was beaten shortly after arriving at the camp when he resisted being strip-searched by guards:</p><blockquote><strong>“When I said I wouldn’t take off my underwear they beat me with an electric baton. And then I fell. They beat me and I was electrocuted… when I came to my senses, they took off my clothes, they searched me, made me bend down, tied hands behind neck. It was very painful.”</strong> [[[28 (check to make sure not in a prison)]]]</blockquote><p>[Pseudonym 17] told Amnesty that he was severely beaten after fighting back against a guard who hit him with a rifle:</p><blockquote><strong>“[One of the guards] said, ‘squat and put your hands on the back of your head!’… I asked why. Then the police hit me with the back of a rifle… I wanted to protect myself so I hit back. He fell down. Then the other police all hit me. When I was being beaten up I heard one voice saying, ‘end him with one bullet’... I thought I was going to die… I wanted not to be killed and I scream… then they sprayed something in my eyes so I couldn’t open them. … Then I was dragged [to my cell]..”</strong> [[[17]]]</blockquote><p>Two survivors reported having their legs shackled during part of their time in detention. [[[LEGS SHACKLED: 32 (first 15 days), 44 (first year) + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 32] told Amnesty that his legs were shackled for 15 days after he was detained. [[[32]]] [Pseudonym 44] told Amnesty his feet were shackled together for the first year he was in a camp.</p><blockquote><strong>“It was a metal chain with 11 links. The two ends on feet with bolts. [It weighed about] 3kg. We could barely step 20cm or more. I could barely walk. It was on 24/7. Every week the guards would check the chain. Every two weeks they would tighten the bolts… [Several months after I arrived in the camp] they offered us water for showering, but always with the chain on. The old inmates showed us how to take your pants off. We took our pants off through the space between the chain and ankle, but it takes a really long time.”</strong> [[[44]]]</blockquote><p>Three survivors told Amnesty that they were sprayed with something, likely pepper spray, while they were in the camps. [[[PEPPER SPRAY: 28, 17 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym] told Amnesty International he was sprayed with something while being interrogated twice while immobilized in a tiger chair. “I was taken [from my cell] to another room and seated on a tiger chair… they didn’t ask me anything. They sprayed something in the air that made it difficult to breathe. [The spray] was small, like [the size] of a bottle of pills. You could put it in your pocket,” he said. [[[17 (?)]]] [Pseudonym] told Amnesty that guards used to spray a white substance into his cell frequently – multiple times a day – which made his throat sore and made it difficult to breathe.

Much about it draws upon Chinese penal practices that have been in place for decades, and many of the human rights violations that survivors describe are endemic features of other Chinese systems of detention.</p><p>Different forms of compulsory re-education of individuals or groups considered to be politically “unreliable” or threats to social stability have existed in China since 1949. In the late 1950s, a new system of custodial re-education known as “re-education through labour” (<em>laodong jiaoyang</em>, RTL) was introduced to deal with “minor counterrevolutionaries” and “rightists”. In the 1980s, the focus shifted to include drug abuse, prostitution, and juvenile delinquency.</p><p>RTL enabled police to confine people without judicial trial for periods of one to three years (with possibility of a one-year extension) for a broad range of unlawful acts considered too minor for criminal prosecution. Millions were locked up under conditions barely distinguishable from – or sometimes even worse than – prisons. Codified regulations and a formal process of hearings gave the institution a veneer of legality, but the lack of judicial trial or, in most cases, legal representation made the deprivation of liberty under RTL inherently arbitrary under international law. Further, RTL was often imposed in a brutal and humiliating fashion, and RTL facilities were a locus of additional human rights violations, including compulsory labour and torture and other ill-treatment.</p><p>Though RTL functioned as a key part of local authorities’ stability-preservation toolkit for decades, its incompatibility with official professions of “rule according to law” and commitment to human rights made it a target of Chinese legal reformers. Those reformers claimed victory when RTL was abolished as an institution in December 2013, but the practice of depriving individuals of their liberty for extended periods under the guise of “education” has continued in different forms since then.</p><p>For example, even before 2013 authorities throughout the country had been using “legal education classes” (<em>falü xuexiban</em>) to detain people arbitrarily for extended periods lasting months. Like their counterparts in XUAR, these sites (which, like RTL, have been used extensively against practitioners of Falun Gong), claimed to provide “classes” or “training” but operate without clear regulations, laws or other public directives to explain their use or operation and how and on what basis individuals are incarcerated there.</p><p>The immediate domestic basis for the facilities in XUAR appears to be Article 14 of the De-Extremification Regulations enacted by the Standing Committee of the XUAR People’s Congress on 29 March 2017, which describes several components of “transformation through education” in superficially positive terms:</p><blockquote><strong>“Eliminating extremism necessitates doing the work of transformation through education well, combining individualized education with education in vocational training centres; legal education with “help and education” (<em>bangjiao huodong</em>); ideological education, psychological counseling and behaviour modification with the study of the national standard spoken and written language, law and technology; and transformation through education with human care to enhance the effectiveness of transformation through education.”</strong></blockquote><p>However, this regulation cannot serve as a basis for deprivation of liberty under Chinese law. Article 7 of China’s Legislation Law makes clear that deprivation of liberty may only be based on laws passed by the National People’s Congress or its standing committee. Though the regulation clearly considers “transformation through education” to be a form of “help and education” (<em>bangjiao</em>) authorized under Article 29 of the Counter-Terrorism Law of the PRC, there is no legitimate way to reconcile the complete deprivation of liberty associated with “transformation through education” facilities in XUAR with the community-based education, surveillance and support that “help and education” ostensibly entails.</p><p>[END TEXT BOX]</p>"}}},"chapter_7":{"type":"chapter","title":"The internment camp release process","content":"<p>The process to determine which detainees are released from camps is not well understood, including by many detainees.

Nothing that survivors experienced during the time leading up to their release indicates any regard to fairness and due process required for deciding individuals’ fates of such gravity.</p><p>Leaked Chinese government documents, particularly the Telegram, provide some insight into how the government intended – at least at one point – the release process to take place. [[[Find]]] Based on testimony from survivors and witnesses and on what we know from the Telegram, the decision to release or transfer someone is essentially the culmination of a process that begins when a detainee is first detained. From that moment, there is an ongoing process of monitoring and evaluation, whereby people are given scores (for more on scores see Chapter&nbsp;X above).

First, “a student evaluation team overseen by the Party organization secretary” undertakes a “preliminary” evaluation and then checks the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP, see above Chapter 4) to see if the platform has flagged any “new problems”. Then, in the absence of any new issues flagged by IJOP, the case is reported “up level-by-level” to three different groups of government cadres, the last of which is the “prefecture (state, city) vocational skills education and training service bureau” that, in concert with “comrades of the local committee”, makes the final determination about whether or not to release the detainee.</p><p>The decision to release a detainee is also based in part on the behaviour of the detainee’s family outside of the camps, which is also being monitored, evaluated, and incorporated into the detainee’s score. A 2017 government directive on how to answer questions from minority students who wonder where their relatives are instructed cadres to tell the students that their behaviour could hurt their relatives’ scores. [[[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-XUAR-documents.html]]] Survivors also said that after they were released they learned their family and friends had been questioned before their release and that their family members had to fill out a long questionnaire.

For example, if parents are sent then it affects the son – he cannot get a job with government or police… Also, for example, the cadres staying with [the families of people who are in camps] overnight had to report back to village committee if anyone prayed. And if they find this, then the score [of the person in the camp] will be lowered<em>…</em> And if a person is sent to re-education camp then that person’s family had to attend classes.

[[[Rome Statute, Articles 7(1)(a) – (k),: “(a) Murder; (b) Extermination; (c) Enslavement; (d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population; (e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; (f) Torture; (g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; (h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectively on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; (i) Enforced disappearance of persons; (j) The crime of apartheid; (k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.”]]]</p><p>The contextual elements of crimes against humanity require that each individual act be perpetrated in the context of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population and with knowledge of the attack.

Moreover, individual culpability for crimes against humanity requires that the perpetrator has a certain degree of knowledge about the crime. Notably, perpetrators must have knowledge of the fact that their actions were part of a widespread or systematic attack. [[[Rome Statute, Article 7(1). See also Prosecutor v. Kupreskic et al., ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgment, 14 January 2000, para. 556 (“[T]he requisite mens rea for crimes against humanity appears to be comprised by (1) the intent to commit the underlying offence, combined with (2) knowledge of the broader context in which that offence occurs.”). See also Prosecutor v. Tadic, ICTY Appeals Chamber, para. 271; Prosecutor v. Kayishema et al., ICTR Trial Chamber, Judgment, 21 May 1999, paras 133-34]]] However, an individual does not need to be personally responsible for the actual widespread or systematic attacks to be found guilty; a single act can be sufficient if and only if it was carried out in the context of a broader attack of which the perpetrator was aware. [[[See cassess international criminal law]]]</p><p>Such attack does not need to be both widespread and systematic, as an attack that is either widespread or systematic will suffice. While one factor involved in determining whether an attack is “widespread” is the number of victims or magnitude of the acts, [[[See Prosecutor v.

[[[Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2019, paras 12 and 13. Supplement No. 10 (A/74/10)]]] The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber has indicated that the assessment of “widespread”, “is neither exclusively quantitative nor geographical, but must be carried out on the basis of the individual facts.” [[[Situation in the Republic of Kenya, Case No. ICC-01/09, Decision pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the authorization of an investigation into the situation in the Republic of Kenya, 31 March 2010, Pre-Trial Chamber II, International Criminal Court, para. 95.

[[[Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1996, vol. II (Part Two), p. 47, para. (4) of the commentary to art. 18 of the draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind.]]]“Systematic” has been held to “signif[y] the organised nature of the acts of violence and the improbability of their random occurrence.” [[[Prosecutor v.

Akayesu, ICTR Trial Chamber, Judgment, 2 September 1998, para. 580.]]] Courts have commonly held the “systematic” threshold to be met when there are “[p]atterns of crimes—that is the nonaccidental repetition of similar criminal conduct on a regular basis.” [[[Prosecutor v. Kunarac et al., ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgment, 22 February 2001, para. 429. See also Prosecutor v.

The term “population,” in the definition of crimes against humanity, has been interpreted to imply the “collective nature of the crime as an attack upon multiple victims,” [[[See Situation in the Republic of Kenya, Decision, 31 March 2010 (footnote 44 above), para. 82; Bemba, Decision, 15 June 2009 (footnote 44 above), para. 77; Kunarac, Judgment, 22 February 2001 (footnote 45 above), para. 424; Tadić, Opinion and Judgment, 7 May 1997 (footnote 40 above), para.644.

The government has carried out a widespread as well as systematic campaign against members of ethnic minorities in XUAR, in furtherance of state policies – in this case as part of the Chinese government’s campaigns to eradicate “terrorism, extremism, and separatism” and to forcibly assimilate Muslim ethnic minorities in XUAR. [Insert number] members of ethnic minorities in XUAR have been imprisoned, tortured, or persecuted as part of the government’s attack. The attack has also been systematic in that the violations have been committed in camps administered by the government and individuals have been subjected to similar violations in the different camps in which they have been imprisoned.</p><p>Amnesty International therefore believes that there is strong grounds to suspect that the following crimes against humanity have been committed and must be investigated:</p><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty</strong> in violation of fundamental rules of international law, including through the arbitrary detention of the estimated 1 million or more men and women in internment camps throughout XUAR.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Torture</strong>, including the physical torture of a significant portion of the internment camp population by prolonged and severe beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, and solitary confinement. The physical and mental ill-treatment of all internment camp detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps may also amount to torture as defined in the Rome Statute. This includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native tongue, living under the constant threat of violence, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Persecution</strong> based on ethnic and religious grounds, including through the ethnically-targeted campaign of mass arbitrary detention and torture, the restrictions on freedom to practice Islam, and restriction on freedom of movement for ethnic minorities.</p></li>\n</ul><p>The survivor testimonies Amnesty International has gathered form the basis of these conclusions; however, these testimonies are corroborated by leaked government documents and other credible testimonial, photographic, and documentary evidence collected by journalists and investigators. Taken together, this evidence clearly illustrates that the serious abuses documented in this report follow a very consistent pattern of criminal conduct and are part of well-documented government policy that is knowingly and purposefully being carried out on a massive scale by government officials all over XUAR. As a result, an independent, impartial, and effective investigation is needed to establish individual responsibility for these crimes.</p><p>In addition to these inhumane acts that Amnesty International has documented there is good reason arising from the pattern of these violations, to believe that Muslim minorities, and especially Uighur ethnic minorities, in XUAR, have been subjected to a system of oppression and domination and that some of the inhuman acts documented in this report have been committed in furtherance of this system of domination and oppression. There may therefore be sufficient evidence to investigate whether this system amounts to the crime against humanity of Apartheid.</p><p>There is further evidence from numerous sources that the crime against humanity of enforced disappearances may also have been committed and reputable organisations have raised the concern that certain conduct may amount to Genocide. Considering the extreme restrictions on accessing XUAR and the difficulties faced in documenting violations committed in the region Amnesty International believes that further investigation into these allegations must also be prioritised.</p><p>Under international law, states may, and in some cases must, exercise universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. [[[Amnesty International, Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and enforce legislation (Index: IOR 53/008/2001), 1 September 2001, Chapter 5.]]] Any state may, under customary international law, undertake one of the following actions against suspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity, even where the suspects are neither nationals nor residents of the state concerned, and the crime(s) did not take place under its jurisdiction or in its territory: bring such persons before its own courts; extradite such persons to any state party willing to do so; or surrender such persons to an international criminal court with jurisdiction to try persons for these crimes. Regarding certain crimes described in this report, in particular torture, exercising universal jurisdiction over perpetrators is a legal obligation, not a choice.

In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses against these peoples. An objective of the government\u2019s current campaign appears to be to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to \u201ctransform\u201d members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.<\/p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and forced assimilation, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment and forced assimilation. It is estimated that more than a million men and women \u2013 Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, Tajiks, and Hui \u2013 have been arbitrarily detained in what the government refers to as \u201cvocational training\u201d or \u201ctransformation through education\u201d centres, but which are more accurately described as internment camps. In these camps, detainees are subjected to a ceaseless forced indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.<\/p><p>The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour of ethnic minorities outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, peaceful assembly, opinion, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.<\/p><p>The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up it abuses in Xinjiang and, in particular, to prevent foreigners from obtaining information about the internment camps. The whereabouts of many of the people sent to internment camps is not known. Many remain in indefinite detention in the camps. Hundreds of thousands have been transferred to situations of forced labour or given long prison sentences. Those who have been permitted to return to their homes do so under strict conditions limiting their movement and associations.<\/p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government\u2019s campaign \u2013 and the associated cover-up \u2013 derive from the government\u2019s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minorities is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert \u2013 along with a substantial portion of the population who have been terrorized into complicity \u2013 to conduct the surveillance, enforce illegal policies, and administer the internment camps, prisons, and forced labour. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.<\/p><p>This report details human rights violations committed by the Government of China in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2021. The findings are based primarily on first-hand testimonial evidence from XX survivors and witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International, XX of whom had never shared their stories publicly before. The report also draws on leaked government documents and a substantial body of public reporting by journalists and other investigators. Evidence demonstrates that the Government of China knowingly and purposefully targeted ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including by unlawful restriction of their basic human rights, as well as by an ethnically targeted campaign of mass detention, and torture and other ill treatment. The government\u2019s actions evince a clear intent to target certain populations collectively on the basis of their ethnicity and religion and to use serious violence and intimidation to outlaw their religious practices and fundamentally weaken their separate ethno-cultural identity. On the basis of the evidence gathered by Amnesty International and from other sources that Amnesty has concluded to be credible, this report concludes that the Government of China has committed serious violations of international human rights law and international criminal law, including crimes against humanity.<\/p><p>The report has 12 chapters:<\/p><ul>\n<li><p>Chapter 2 describes the research methodology and details the obstacles to conducting human rights research in Xinjiang.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 3 provides background information on Xinjiang and gives an overview of the cycles of violence, discrimination, and repression that occurred in Xinjiang from the 1980s to 2016.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 4 describes major human rights violations in Xinjiang since 2017 that have occurred outside the camps, including the severe restrictions on freedom of religion, freedom of movement, and privacy.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 5 focuses on what happens to detainees from the time they are detained until they enter an internment camp: the process of arbitrary detention, interrogation, biometric data collection, and transfer to a camp.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 6 details life for detainees inside the internment camps, including the conditions in the camps, the highly regimented daily routines, and the content of the \u201cre-education\u201d curriculum.

The report\u2019s findings and conclusions draw heavily from first-hand testimonies that Amnesty International gathered from survivors and witnesses, as well as an analysis of satellite imagery and data. The report also draws on testimonial evidence and confidential government documents gathered from journalists, diaspora groups, and other human rights organizations.<\/p><p>Between October 2019 and April 2021, Amnesty International interviewed XXX people with knowledge of the situation in Xinjiang, China: XX (XX men and XX women) were survivors of internment camps, XX had lived in or visited Xinjiang since 2017, X had worked in the internment camp system, XX were family members of detainees. The interviewees included XX Kazakhs, XX Uyghurs, X Kyrgzy, X Uzbeks, X Tajiks, and X Han Chinese.<\/p><p>These testimonies represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation in Xinjiang since 2017. According to the Shahit database \u2013 a [non-governmental] [unofficial] website that aggregates and synthesizes all publicly available testimony related to the Xinjiang internment camps \u2013 excluding the survivors interviewed in this report, only XX camp survivors have ever spoken publicly.

Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of two days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Mandarin, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz; a few were conducted in English. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey and remotely in XX other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with survivors and witnesses were conducted individually.<\/p><p>For reasons related to the security of the potential interviewees, no interviews were conducted in Xinjiang either in person or remotely. The government of China threatens, detains, tortures, and forcibly disappears individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Many survivors and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken with Amnesty International. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee\u2019s name and\/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee\u2019s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Moreover, since only a small number of internment camp survivors (likely a few hundred) are believed to have left China, and because the government likely knows the identity of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very conservative approach to including any information that could be identifying. For example, none of the testimony in this report is associated with a specific internment camp where an interviewee was detained or with a specific village or town where an interviewee had lived, and only rarely with a specific age or occupation of the interviewee. <\/p>","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in Xinjiang","content":"<p>The Government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China \u2013 particularly internment camp survivors \u2013 have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in Xinjiang. The possibility of communication from Xinjiang over a genuinely secure form of communication is remote and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are under heavy surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Anyone living in Xinjiang who does speak out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, or is accused of speaking out risks arrest, detention, imprisonment, torture, and enforced disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.<\/p><p>The risks are even more severe for ex-detainees and their families, who already face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-internees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Every internment camp survivor who spoke with Amnesty had, prior to being released, been made signed a document that forbid them from speaking with anybody \u2013 especially journalists and foreigners \u2013 about what they experienced in the camp. The document reportedly specifies that if they violate this prohibition they will be interned again, along with members of their family (see Chapter&nbsp;X).<\/p><p>As a result of the obstacles and risks facing people in Xinjiang, with few exceptions the vast majority of credible testimonial evidence about the situation has been gathered from survivors and witnesses who have left Xinjiang and spoken from abroad. Speaking from abroad is also difficult and comes with serious risks, especially for family members of the person speaking who remain in China. [[[See https:\/\/www.amnesty.org\/en\/latest\/research\/2020\/02\/china-uyghurs-abroad-living-in-fear\/]]] Since at least 2017, obtaining permission to travel abroad \u2013 and, in many cases, domestically \u2013 has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs, and extraordinarily difficult for other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Members of ethnic minority groups who have obtained permission to travel abroad since 2017 appear to require a connection to a foreign country (usually citizenship or immediate family) and one or more \u201cguarantors\u201d in Xinjiang who agree, in writing, that they will be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing speaks or shares information about the internment camps or does not return to China on time. As documented in this report and elsewhere, these are not empty threats: family members of people who speak about the issue from abroad have been sent to internment camps and in some cases disappeared (see Chapter&nbsp;X).<\/p><p>Independent journalists, human rights investigators, and diplomats have all been denied unfettered access to the region. A few journalists have entered disguised as tourists but have found it nearly impossible to speak safely with people about the internment camps. [[[Cite PBS and Vice]]] Those who have travelled to the region officially have encountered a coordinated effort by government officials to block them from speaking with survivors and witnesses and from accessing internment camps, except in situations where the government tries to exercise complete control over where they visit, what they see, who they speak with, and what is said to them. [[[Cite Channel 4, BBC, etc]]]<\/p><p>Reporting about the situation from abroad also carries significant risk. In several instances, when journalists with family in Xinjiang have reported on or spoken about the situation in Xinjiang from abroad, family members have been arrested, sent to a camp or prison, or disappeared. [[[Add in examples from RFA and others, and from our campaign \u201ccases\u201d]]]<\/p><p>Chinese government officials have also made a concerted effort to disseminate misinformation, both to foreigners and to the local population, about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Several internment camp survivors told Amnesty International that they were forced to give false statements to their families or to the media, both while interned and after they had been released. [[[CITE AI EXAMPLES OF SURVIVORS BEING FORCED TO GIVE FALSE STATEMENTS: B2, Z1, etc; And other examples:]]] Several survivors told Amnesty that while they were detained they had been coached about what to say to foreign journalists or Chinese government delegations that visited their camp.

A huge area \u2013 1.66&nbsp;million km<sup>2<\/sup> \u2013 it encompasses approximately one-sixth of China\u2019s landmass and is bordered by eight countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Afghanistan. [[[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Xinjiang]]] The area comprises vast semi-desert steppes in the north and severe desert basins ringed by historic oasis towns in the south.<\/p><p>The XUAR is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. According to China\u2019s 2010 census the region had a population of approximately 22 million. More than half of the region\u2019s population belongs to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million), Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and other populations whose languages, cultures, and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han, who are the majority in \u201cinterior\u201d China.<\/p><p>The area covered by the XUAR was renowned over centuries for the ancient Silk Road and its flourishing conduit of trade and culture between China and the rest of the world. Rich in coal, natural gas, and oil, the XUAR is intertwined with many of China\u2019s economic, strategic, and foreign policy goals. China\u2019s leaders now consider stability in the XUAR vital to the success of the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d, a massive global infrastructure development programme aimed at strengthening China\u2019s links to Central Asia and beyond.<\/p><p>The XUAR is one of the five autonomous regions of the PRC, where the officially recognized \u201cnational minorities\u201d are granted some formal representation in the organs of regional government. The autonomy conferred to these regions by the PRC constitution and the Law on Regional Autonomy has remained largely symbolic. In the XUAR, as in the rest of the PRC, all major policy decisions are taken by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<\/p><p>The Government of China considers the XUAR to have been an inseparable part of China for millennia. But this history is disputed by many, particularly Uyghurs, who often perceive China as a colonizing force and aspire to independence. Aspirations towards independence have their roots in both the distant past and recent history. During the 1930s and 1940s, two independent Republics of Eastern Turkestan were formed successively in Kashgar (1933) and Ili (1944) as attempts to resist Chinese rule. [[[See Linda Benson, \u201cThe Ili Rebellion: The Moslem Challenge to Chinese Authority in Xinjiang, 1944-1949\", M.E. Sharpe, New York, 1990; and Dru C. Gladney, \u201cInternal colonialism and the Uyghur nationality: Chinese nationalism and its subaltern subject\u201d, in CEMOTI (Cahiers d\u2019Etudes sur la Mediterranee Orientale et le monde Turco-Iranien), No.25, janvier-juin 1998, pp.47-61.]]] Both republics were short-lived, but they have continued to inspire nationalist opposition since 1949, particularly among some? Uyghurs. Over the years, various opposition groups calling for \u201cEastern Turkestan\u2019s\u201d independence were formed clandestinely in the XUAR. Some of these groups have resorted to violence (see below).<\/p><p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. In 1949, the local Turkic population, in majority Uyghur, accounted for at least 93% of the region\u2019s population, while ethnic Chinese in the region amounted to about 6 or 7% of the population. According to official statistics, Han Chinese now make up approximately 40% of the population. With the massive influx of Han Chinese, Indigenous groups have felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land. [[[See Lillian Craig Harris, \u201cXinjiang, Central Asia and the Implications for China\u2019s Policy in the Islamic World\u201d, in The China Quarterly, No.133, March 1993, pp.111-129, and Nicholas Becquelin, \u201cTrouble on the Marches\u201d, in China Perspectives No.10, March\/April 1997, pp.19-28.]]]<\/p><p>During the first three decades of the PRC, resettlement of Han Chinese into the XUAR was facilitated by what is now called the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (commonly known as the Bingtuan), an institution established in the early 1950s. The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize Xinjiang, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of the XUAR, separating the north, where most Kazakhs in Xinjiang live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from the XUAR regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons.

While the government had severely restricted the human rights of ethnic minorities for decades (see Chapter 3 above), the new limitations were dramatically more severe than anything imposed previously. An objective of the government\u2019s current campaign appears to be to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours, and ultimately to \u201ctransform\u201d members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.<\/p><p>To achieve this forced political indoctrination and cultural assimilation, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment. It has been estimated that more than a million men and women have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps (see Chapters 5 \u2013 8). The internment camp system is one part of a larger campaign of subjugation and forced assimilation of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The government has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour outside the camps. These policies violate multiple human rights, including to security and liberty of person, and to privacy; the freedoms of movement, opinion, expression, thought, conscience, and religion and belief; and to equality before the law and non-discrimination. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.<\/p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government\u2019s campaign \u2013 and the associated cover-up \u2013 derive from the government\u2019s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize large portions of the region\u2019s population to help enforce its will.

Unlike torture as defined in the CAT, there is no purposive requirement that the ill-treatment be committed for, \u201csuch purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.\u201d Further there is no requirement that the ill-treatment be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d In addition the Rome Statute does not explicitly differentiate between torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment as does CAT. The ill-treatment that would constitute the crime against humanity of torture when committed within the contextual elements must therefore be understood to be more broadly defined than under CAT. However, the ICC has clarified that, \u201calthough there is no definition of the severity threshold as a legal requirement of the crime of torture, it is constantly accepted in applicable treaties and jurisprudence that an important degree of pain and suffering has to be reached in order for a criminal act to amount to an opact of torture.\u201d [[[Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute ICC-01\/05-01\/08 15 June 2009 para 193]]] In reaching this conclusion the Court relied on the definition of torture from CAT, implying that the standard of severity that it would apply would be similar to that applicable under CAT. In any case the ICC will not judge the severity of each incident of ill-treatment, instead it will consider the cumulative effect of a course of conduct. [[[Prosecutor v.

The Committee Against Torture (CAT), the expert UN body charged with overseeing the treaty\u2019s implementation, has repeatedly raised concerns about a number of issues in China including: the lack of a definition of torture in domestic laws that accords with that of UNCAT; exclusion at trial of evidence obtained through torture and other ill-treatment; arbitrary detention where there is a high probability of torture and other ill-treatment; torture and other ill-treatment of human rights defenders; and the lack of independence of judges and lawyers.

One survivor stated that the camp she was interned in had a \u201cdark\u201d, coffin-like room, which was a windowless room without light, about two metres by one metre, where detainees were sent if they misbehaved. She told Amnesty how she was put in the room for two days:<\/p><p><strong>\u201cOn that day a 70-year-old lady spoke her mother tongue, Uyghur, in our cell. \u2026 The guards wanted to take her to a tiger chair.

Guards routinely beat detainees who misbehave, even for the most trivial offences. Amnesty International interviewed XX people who reported being beaten during detention. [[[BEATINGS: 37, 17, 18 (interviewed before), 14, 16, 35, 17, 7, 28 (f), 27 (f)]]] Electric batons were often used to electrocute people and to beat people with.

And then I fell. They beat me and I was electrocuted\u2026 when I came to my senses, they took off my clothes, they searched me, made me bend down, tied hands behind neck. It was very painful.\u201d<\/strong> [[[C2 (check to make sure not in a prison)]]]<\/p><p>Two survivors reported having their legs shackled during part of their time in detention.

Every two weeks they would tighten the bolts\u2026 [Several months after I arrived in the camp] they offered us water for showering, but always with the chain on. The old inmates showed us how to take your pants off. We took our pants off through the space between the chain and ankle, but it takes a really long time.\u201d<\/strong> [[[44]]]<\/p><p>Three survivors told Amnesty that they were sprayed with something, likely pepper spray, while they were in the camps.

They sprayed something in the air that made it difficult to breathe. [The spray] was small, like [the size] of a bottle of pills. You could put it in your pocket,\u201d he said.

There is also significant debate about whether the decision to release at least some of the detainees was a consequence of a sea change in government policy or a result of what should be considered normal turnover for detainees who had already spent considerable time in the camps and fulfilled the criteria for being released (see the text box below).<\/p><p>It is also plausible that many of the detainees were released as a consequence of a policy change with respect to one ethnic minority group only: ethnic Kazakhs.

Several survivors said the verdicts were given at the end of a process referred to as a trial. However, survivors interviewed by Amnesty did not experience anything that resembled a genuine judicial or even administrative process, let alone anything coming close to observing fair trial guarantees. They had no opportunity to defend themselves, examine any evidence, or consult a lawyer.

Notably, perpetrators must have knowledge of the fact that their actions were part of a widespread or systematic attack. [[[Rome Statute, Article 7(1). See also Prosecutor v.

The government has carried out a widespread as well as systematic campaign against members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, in furtherance of state policies \u2013 in this case as part of the Chinese government\u2019s campaigns to eradicate \u201cterrorism, extremism, and separatism\u201d and to forcibly assimilate Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. [Insert number] members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been imprisoned, tortured, or persecuted as part of the government\u2019s attack. The attack has also been systematic in that the violations have been committed in camps administered by the government and individuals have been subjected to similar violations in the different camps in which they have been imprisoned.<\/p><p>Amnesty International therefore believes that there is strong grounds to suspect that the following crimes against humanity have been committed and must be investigated:<\/p><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty<\/strong> in violation of fundamental rules of international law, including through the arbitrary detention of the estimated 1 million or more men and women in internment camps throughout Xinjiang.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Torture<\/strong>, including the physical torture of a significant portion of the internment camp population by prolonged and severe beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, and solitary confinement. The physical and mental ill-treatment of all internment camp detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps may also amount to torture as defined in the Rome Statute. This includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native tongue, living under the constant threat of violence, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Persecution<\/strong> based on ethnic and religious grounds, including through the ethnically-targeted campaign of mass arbitrary detention and torture, the restrictions on freedom to practice Islam, and restriction on freedom of movement for ethnic minorities.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>The survivor testimonies Amnesty International has gathered form the basis of these conclusions; however, these testimonies are corroborated by leaked government documents and other credible testimonial, photographic, and documentary evidence collected by journalists and investigators. Taken together, this evidence clearly illustrates that the serious abuses documented in this report follow a very consistent pattern of criminal conduct and are part of well-documented government policy that is knowingly and purposefully being carried out on a massive scale by government officials all over Xinjiang. As a result, an independent, impartial, and effective investigation is needed to establish individual responsibility for these crimes.<\/p><p>In addition to these inhumane acts that Amnesty International has documented there is good reason arising from the pattern of these violations, to believe that Muslim minorities, and especially Uighur ethnic minorities, in Xinjiang, have been subjected to a system of oppression and domination and that some of the inhuman acts documented in this report have been committed in furtherance of this system of domination and oppression. There may therefore be sufficient evidence to investigate whether this system amounts to the crime against humanity of Apartheid. There is further evidence from numerous sources that the crime against humanity of enforced disappearances may also have been committed and reputable organisations have raised the concern that certain conduct may amount to Genocide. Considering the extreme restrictions on accessing Xinjiang and the difficulties faced in documenting violations committed in the region Amnesty International believes that further investigation into these allegations must also be prioritised.<\/p><p>Under international law, states may, and in some cases must, exercise universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. [[[Amnesty International, Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and enforce legislation (Index: IOR 53\/008\/2001), 1 September 2001, Chapter 5.]]] Any state may, under customary international law, undertake one of the following actions against suspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity, even where the suspects are neither nationals nor residents of the state concerned, and the crime(s) did not take place under its jurisdiction or in its territory: bring such persons before its own courts; extradite such persons to any state party willing to do so; or surrender such persons to an international criminal court with jurisdiction to try persons for these crimes. Regarding certain crimes described in this report, in particular torture, exercising universal jurisdiction over perpetrators is a legal obligation, not a choice.

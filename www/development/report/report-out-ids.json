{"chapter_1":{"type":"introduction","title":"Executive Summary","content":"<p>Since 2017, under the guise of a campaign against \u201cterrorism\u201d, the government of China has carried out massive and systematic abuses against Muslims living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). Far from a legitimate response to the purported terrorist threat, the government\u2019s campaign evinces a clear intent to target parts of Xinjiang\u2019s population collectively on the basis of religion and ethnicity and to use severe violence and intimidation to root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices. The government aims to replace these beliefs and practices with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours, and, ultimately, to forcibly assimilate members of these ethnic groups into a homogenous Chinese nation possessing a unified language, culture, and unwavering loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<\/p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation, the government undertook a campaign of arbitrary mass detention. Huge numbers of men and women from predominantly Muslim ethnic groups have been detained. They include hundreds of thousands who have been sent to prisons as well as hundreds of thousands \u2013 perhaps 1&nbsp;million or more \u2013 who have been sent to what the government refers to as \u201ctraining\u201d or \u201ceducation\u201d centres. These facilities are more accurately described as internment camps. Detainees in these camps are subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.<\/p><p>The internment camp system is part of a larger campaign of subjugation and forced assimilation of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The government of China has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict the behaviour of Muslims in Xinjiang. These policies violate multiple human rights, including the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion, and belief; to participate in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination. These violations are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life for millions of members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.<\/p><p>The government of China has taken extreme measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented, and finding reliable information about life inside the internment camps is particularly difficult. Between October 2019 and May 2021, Amnesty International interviewed dozens of former detainees and other people who were present in Xinjiang since 2017, most of whom had never spoken publicly about their experiences before. The testimonies of former detainees represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation inside the internment camps since 2017.<\/p><p><em><strong>The evidence Amnesty International has gathered provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the Chinese government has committed at least the following crimes against humanity: imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; torture; and persecution.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Amnesty International interviewed 55 people who had been detained in internment camps and later released. All of them had been arbitrarily detained for what appears to be, by all reasonable standards, entirely lawful conduct; that is, without having committed any internationally recognized criminal offence. The internment camp detention process appears to be operating outside the scope of the Chinese criminal justice system or other domestic law. According to government documents and statements by government officials, applying criminal procedure would be inappropriate because the people in the camps are there \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and are not criminals. As demonstrated by the testimonies and other evidence presented in this report, however, attendance in the camps is not voluntary, and conditions in the camps are an affront to human dignity.<\/p><p>Aiman, a government official who participated in mass arrests, told Amnesty how, in late 2017, police took people from their homes without warning, how family members of the detained people reacted, and what the role of government cadres was in the process:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cI was there\u2026 The police would take people out of their houses\u2026 with hands handcuffed behind them, including women\u2026 and they put black hoods on them\u2026 Nobody could resist. Imagine if all of a sudden a group [of police] enters [your home], cuffs you and puts [a black hood] over your head\u2026 It was very sad\u2026 [Afterwards] I cried\u2026 That night we made 60 arrests\u2026 That was just in one district [of many where people were being detained]\u2026 Every day they arrested more people.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>Individuals Amnesty International interviewed said the reasons they were given for their detention were often not tied to specific acts; rather, detainees were informed that they had been detained because they had been classified as \u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d or as a \u201cterrorist\u201d or an \u201cextremist\u201d. When specific acts were mentioned, they generally fell into a few broad categories. One category includes offences related to foreign countries. Numerous former detainees were sent to camps for living, travelling, or studying abroad or for communicating with people abroad. Many were even detained simply for being \u201cconnected\u201d with people who lived, travelled, studied, or communicated with people abroad. Another category includes those detained for offences related to using unauthorized software or digital communications technology. Many former detainees were sent to camps for using or having forbidden software applications on their mobile phones. Another common category includes anything related to religion. Former detainees were sent to camps for reasons related to Islamic beliefs or practice, including working in a mosque, praying, having a prayer mat, or possessing a picture or a video with a religious theme.<\/p><p>Analysed in concert with other testimonial and documentary evidence gathered by journalists and other organizations, the testimonial evidence Amnesty International has gathered demonstrates that members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang were often detained on the basis of what can only be considered \u201cguilt by association\u201d. Many were interned as a result of their relationships, or perceived or alleged relationships, with family, friends, or community members \u2013 many, if not most, of whom were themselves not guilty of any internationally recognized criminal offence.<\/p><p>In internment camps, all detainees were subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment. From the moment they entered a camp, detainees\u2019 lives were extraordinarily regimented. They were stripped of their personal autonomy, with every aspect of their lives being dictated to them. Detainees who deviated from the conduct prescribed by camp authorities \u2013 even in the most seemingly innocuous ways \u2013 were reprimanded and regularly physically punished, often along with their cellmates.<\/p><p>Detainees had no privacy. They were monitored at all times, including when they ate, slept, and used the toilet. They were forbidden to talk freely with other detainees. When detainees were permitted to speak \u2013 to other detainees, guards, or teachers \u2013 they were required to speak in Mandarin Chinese, a language many of them, especially older people and those from more rural areas in Xinjiang, did not speak or understand. Detainees were physically punished if they spoke in a language other than Mandarin.<\/p><p>There was insufficient food, water, exercise, healthcare, sanitary and hygienic conditions, fresh air, and exposure to natural light. Detainees had draconian restrictions placed on their ability to urinate and defecate. All detainees were required to \u201cwork\u201d one- or two-hour shifts monitoring their cellmates every night. Many former detainees reported that during the first few days, weeks, or sometimes months after arriving at the internment camps, they were forced to do nothing but sit still \u2013 often in terribly uncomfortable positions \u2013 for nearly the entire day.<\/p><p>At some point after arriving nearly all detainees were subjected to highly regimented classes. The typical schedule included three or four hours of classes after breakfast. Then detainees had lunch and a short \u201crest\u201d, which often involved sitting still on a stool or with their heads still on their desks. After lunch there was another three or four hours of classes and then dinner, followed by a few hours to sit or kneel on a stool and silently \u201creview\u201d the day\u2019s material or to watch more \u201ceducational\u201d videos. At nearly all times during classes, detainees were required to look straight ahead and not to speak with their classmates. Classes often involved memorizing and reciting \u201cred\u201d songs \u2013 that is, revolutionary songs that praise the CCP and the People\u2019s Republic of China.<\/p><p>Teaching Chinese was a primary objective of the \u201ceducation\u201d that detainees received in the camps. In addition to language classes, most former detainees reported attending some combination of history, law, and ideology classes or, as many former detainees referred to it, \u201cpolitical education\u201d. These classes focused largely on forcibly indoctrinating detainees about the \u201cevils\u201d of Islam and about how prosperous, powerful, and \u201cbenevolent\u201d China, the CCP, and President Xi Jinping are. Yerulan, a former detainee, told Amnesty he believed the political education classes were structured to prevent detainees from having and practising their religion:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cI think the purpose [of the classes] was to destroy our religion and to assimilate us\u2026 They said that we couldn\u2019t say \u2018<em>as-salamu alaykum<\/em>\u2019 and that if we were asked what our ethnicity was we should say \u2018Chinese\u2019\u2026 They said that you could not go to Friday prayers\u2026 And that it was not Allah who gave you all, it was Xi Jinping. You must not thank Allah; you must thank Xi Jinping for everything.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>Detainees were questioned or interrogated regularly. They were also frequently required to write letters of \u201cconfession\u201d or \u201cself-criticism\u201d. In addition to confessing one\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u201d, self-criticism entailed describing in writing what the detainee had done wrong, explaining that the education they were receiving enabled them to recognize the error of their ways and \u201ctransform\u201d their thinking, expressing gratitude to the government for this education, and promising not to return to their old habits.<\/p><p>Every former camp detainee Amnesty International interviewed was tortured or subjected to other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (in this report referred to as \u201ctorture or other ill-treatment\u201d) during their internment. Torture and other ill-treatment are constitutive elements of life in the internment camps. The torture and other ill-treatment that detainees experience in the camps fall into two broad categories.<\/p><p>The first category included the physical and non-physical (that is, mental or psychological) torture and other ill-treatment experienced by <em>all<\/em> detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps. The combination of these physical and non-physical measures, in conjunction with the total loss of control and personal autonomy in the camps, is likely to cause mental and physical suffering severe enough to constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.<\/p><p>The second category of torture and other ill-treatment included physical torture and other ill-treatment that occurred during interrogations or as punishment for misbehaviour by <em>specific<\/em> detainees. Torture methods used during interrogations and as punishment included beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, being hung from a wall, being subjected to extremely cold temperatures, and solitary confinement. Interrogations usually lasted an hour or more; punishments were often much longer.<\/p><p>Amnesty International interviewed many former detainees who were tortured or subjected to other ill-treatment during interrogations or punishments in internment camps. Amnesty also interviewed many former detainees who witnessed the torture or other ill-treatment of other detainees or who spoke with other detainees \u2013 usually their cellmates \u2013 who informed them that they had been tortured or otherwise ill-treated during interrogations or as punishment.<\/p><p>Former detainees described a broadly consistent pattern of treatment of detainees by staff and officials in the camps. Some of this treatment reflected patterns of torture and other ill-treatment that Chinese security forces have carried out in Xinjiang and other parts of China for decades. Mansur, a farmer, described to Amnesty how he was tortured multiple times in two camps during his time in detention \u2013 both during an interrogation and during multiple punishment sessions. He described his interrogation session:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cTwo guards took me from the cell and dropped me off [at the room where I was interrogated]. Two men were inside\u2026 [They asked what I did in Kazakhstan,] \u2018Did you pray there? What do your parents do?\u2019 I said I only stayed with family, that I took care of livestock, and that I didn\u2019t do anything illegal\u2026 they asked me about mosque and praying\u2026 If I told them I had been praying, I had heard that I would get sentenced for 20 or 25 years. So I told them I never prayed. Then they became upset. They said, \u2018All that time with livestock, you became an animal too!\u2019 Then they hit me with a chair until it broke\u2026 I fell to the floor. I almost fainted\u2026 Then they put me on the chair again. They said, \u2018this guy hasn\u2019t changed yet, he needs to stay [in the camp] longer\u2019.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>Amnesty International documented one account of a death in an internment camp caused by torture. Madi told Amnesty he witnessed the torture of a cellmate who he later learned died from the effects of the torture. Madi said the man was made to sit in a tiger chair in the middle of their cell. The cellmates were made to watch him sit there, restrained and immobilized, for three days, and were expressly forbidden to help him.<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201c[The man] was in our room for more than two months\u2026 he was made to sit in a tiger chair. [I think the man was being punished for pushing a guard.]\u2026 They brought the chair into our room\u2026 They told us that if we helped him then we would sit in the chair\u2026 It was an iron chair\u2026 his arms were cuffed and chained. Legs were chained as well. His body was tied to the back of the chair\u2026 Two [cuffs] were locked around his wrists and legs\u2026 A rubber thing attached to the ribs to make the person [sit] up straight\u2026 at some point we could see his testicles. He would [urinate and defecate] in the chair. He was in the chair for three nights\u2026 He died after he [was taken out of the cell]. We found out through [people] in the cell.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>Most of the detainees interviewed by Amnesty were in the camps for between nine and 18 months. The process to determine whether detainees were released from camps and sent home is not well understood, including by many detainees. Like the process surrounding the initial detention and transfer to the internment camp, much of the release process appeared to operate outside the scope of the Chinese criminal justice system or other domestic law. There was a total absence of any transparent criteria or legal assistance and protection. Nothing that former detainees experienced during the time leading up to their release indicated any regard for the fairness and due process required by the gravity of deciding individuals\u2019 fates. Detainees who were released were forced to sign a document that forbade them from speaking with anybody \u2013 especially journalists and foreign nationals \u2013 about what they experienced in the camp. Former detainees were informed that they would be interned again if they violated this prohibition, as would members of their families.<\/p><p>After being released from internment camps to go home, former detainees faced further severe restrictions on their human rights, particularly their freedom of movement. These restrictions were in addition to the discriminatory policies directed at all members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang. Nearly all former detainees who spoke to Amnesty were required to continue their \u201ceducation\u201d and to attend classes in Chinese language and political ideology after they were released. They were also forced to publicly \u201cconfess\u201d their \u201ccrimes\u201d at flag-raising ceremonies.<\/p><p>All former detainees Amnesty International interviewed said they were placed under both electronic and in-person surveillance and subjected to regular evaluations from government employees and cadres. Nearly all former detainees reported that government employees or cadres were required to stay with them in their homes for several nights per month after they were released from a camp. For at least several months, nearly all were prohibited from leaving their village or township. If they were allowed to leave, they were required to get written permission from the authorities beforehand.<\/p><p>Amnesty interviewed former detainees who were sent from the camps to work in factories. Arzu told Amnesty that after spending six months in one camp he was transferred to another camp, where he was taught to sew in preparation for being sent to a factory. He was then required to live and work in a factory for several months making government uniforms. These testimonies point to a number of ways in which the authorities in Xinjiang appear to be forcing or compelling Uyghurs and other members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang to engage in certain types of labour, sometimes as an extension of the \u201ceducation\u201d received in the camps.<\/p><p>Some detainees were reportedly transferred from camps to prisons. Like the process of being released to go home, the seemingly related process through which camp detainees were given prison sentences is not well understood. It is also unclear how the release process and the sentencing process were connected \u2013 especially how, or if, the prison sentencing process in the camps was integrated with any formal sentencing process outside the camps.<\/p><p>Amnesty International was not able to interview anyone who was given a prison sentence in a camp and then sent to a prison. Amnesty did, however, interview former camp detainees who said they were given sentences that were subsequently \u201cforgiven\u201d. Amnesty also interviewed former detainees who said that while they were detained, one or more of the people in their classes received prison sentences, often apparently for everyday behaviour far removed from any type of recognized offence. Many of the former detainees personally knew other people \u2013 usually multiple people \u2013 who had been given prison sentences.<\/p><p>The government of China has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour of <em>all<\/em> members of predominately Muslim ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to a camp or prison. The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government\u2019s campaign derive from the government\u2019s unprecedented use of surveillance technology, coupled with its ability to make large portions of the region\u2019s population help it to execute its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minority groups is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a non-independent legal system act in concert to conduct the surveillance and enforce rights-violating policies.<\/p><p>Muslims living in Xinjiang may be the most closely surveilled population in the world. The government of China has devoted tremendous resources to gathering incredibly detailed information about this group\u2019s lives. This systemized mass surveillance is achieved through a combination of policies and practices that infringe on people\u2019s rights to privacy and freedom of movement and expression. According to former residents of Xinjiang, the system of surveillance involves extensive, invasive in-person and electronic monitoring in the form of:<\/p><ul>\n<li><p>biometric data collection, including iris scans and facial imagery;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>invasive interviews by government officials;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>regular searches and interrogations by ubiquitous security officers;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>\u201chomestays\u201d by government employees and cadres assigned to live with ethnic minority families;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>an ever-present network of surveillance cameras, including facial recognition cameras;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>a vast network of checkpoints known as \u201cconvenience police stations\u201d; and<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>unfettered access to people\u2019s personal communication devices and financial history.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>In addition to providing the government with enormous amounts of personal information, this operation allows the authorities to comprehensively track \u2013 in real time \u2013 the communications, movements, actions, and behaviours of Xinjiang\u2019s ethnic minority populations.<\/p><p>Muslims living in Xinjiang cannot move freely. The government restricts their travel both within Xinjiang and between Xinjiang and the rest of China. The government also makes it extraordinarily difficult \u2013 often impossible \u2013 for members of ethnic minority groups, particularly Uyghurs, to travel abroad. All members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang were forced to hand over their passports to the government in 2016 and 2017. Very few people have been able to get them back.<\/p><p>Former residents of Xinjiang said movement restrictions are enforced in a discriminatory manner. Interviewees said the police stopped only ethnic minorities on the street and checked their ID. Witnesses, including one who worked at a government checkpoint, reported that Han Chinese either did not need to go through the checkpoints at all or were essentially waved through without having their bodies or phones searched and without being questioned. Yin, a Han Chinese person who visited Xinjiang, told Amnesty about the discrimination they witnessed while travelling:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cThe surveillance cameras are literally everywhere\u2026 The discrimination is so blatant. When I boarded a train, they didn\u2019t check anything, but the Uyghurs sitting right across from me, they checked their tickets and their phones\u2026 When I was in the station, there were two lines [for security checks], one for Uyghurs and one for Han without facial recognition, just through a metal detector. The line for Uyghurs was very long\u2026 Under a tunnel in [a major city] I just walked by, but Uyghurs had to have a full body check with metal detectors, including old men. They were checked at both sides of the tunnel. I was carrying luggage, and no one even checked my bag. I went through the [security] door, but no one checked with a wand\u2026 Because I am Han, I was not checked\u2026 I spoke with a [government official] who said, \u2018Uyghurs have to be treated differently because there are no Han terrorists\u2019.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>Muslims living in Xinjiang cannot practise their religion. Former detainees and other people interviewed by Amnesty International who lived in Xinjiang between 2017 and early 2021 also described an environment that was extraordinarily hostile to the practice of Islam. By the time these individuals left China, none felt comfortable displaying any signs of religious practice and all believed doing so would result in them being detained and sent to a camp. According to these witnesses, numerous Islamic practices that Muslims widely consider essential to their religion that were not explicitly prohibited by law in Xinjiang are now, in effect, prohibited. Muslims are prevented from praying, attending mosques, teaching religion, wearing religious clothing, and giving children Islamic-sounding names. As a result of the constant, credible threat of detention, Muslims in Xinjiang modified their behaviour to such an extent that they no longer displayed outward signs of religious practice.<\/p><p>Numerous former residents of Xinjiang told Amnesty they were forbidden to possess any religious artefacts in their houses or any religious content on their phones, including religious books, films, or photographs. Several former residents also said cultural books, artefacts, and other content associated with Turkic Muslim culture have, in effect, been banned. Aiman told Amnesty how government cadres and police barged into the houses of Muslim families and forcibly confiscated all religious artefacts:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cWe went to [a part of the village] where 20 families from [a Muslim ethnic group] lived. We had to take out everything to do with religion and show them that these were illegal things\u2026 While we were doing this, we wouldn\u2019t even knock on the door\u2026 We would just go in without asking for permission\u2026 People were crying\u2026 We gave everything to the police\u2026 We also told them to remove things written in Arabic.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>According to the evidence Amnesty International has gathered, corroborated by other reliable sources, members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been subjected to an attack meeting all the contextual elements of crimes against humanity under international law. The evidence Amnesty has seen therefore provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the perpetrators, acting on behalf of the Chinese state, have carried out a widespread and systematic attack consisting of a planned, massive, organized, and systematic pattern of serious violations directed at the civilian population in Xinjiang. <em>Amnesty International believes the evidence it has collected provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the Chinese government has committed at least the following crimes against humanity: imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; torture; and persecution.<\/em><\/p><p>The government of China must immediately close all the remaining internment camps and release all persons held in internment camps or other detention facilities \u2013 including prisons \u2013 in Xinjiang, unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognized offence. The government must also repeal or amend all laws and regulations, and end all related policies and practical measures, that impermissibly restrict the human rights of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including the right to freely leave and return to China and to choose and practise their religion.<\/p><p>An independent and effective investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity and other serious violations of human rights documented in this report is required. All those reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility should be brought to justice in fair&nbsp;trials. In particular, the UN Human Rights Council or the UN General Assembly must establish an independent international mechanism to investigate crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang, with a view to ensuring accountability, including through the identification of suspected perpetrators.<\/p>","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"Methodology","content":"<p>This report is a product of field and remote research carried out between October 2019 and May 2021. The report\u2019s findings and conclusions are based on first-hand testimonies that Amnesty International gathered from former detainees of the internment camps and other people who were present in Xinjiang after 2017, as well as from an analysis of satellite imagery and data. The report also draws on testimonial evidence and confidential government documents gathered and analysed by journalists, scholars, and other human rights organizations.<\/p><p>108 people were interviewed for this report: 55 former detainees of internment camps in Xinjiang (37 men and 16 women), 15 other people who lived in or visited Xinjiang since 2017, and 48 family members of people from Xinjiang who are currently missing or detained. The majority of the interviewees were Kazakh, a minority were Uyghurs, and a small number were Kyrgyz, or Han Chinese.<\/p><p>The former detainee testimonies represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation inside the internment camps since 2017. Forty-four of the 55 former detainees interviewed for this report had never shared any part of their stories publicly before, and several others had never shared significant portions of their stories. According to the Xinjiang Victims Database \u2013 a website run by human rights researchers and activists that aggregates and synthesizes all publicly available testimony related to Xinjiang internment camps \u2013 excluding the former detainees interviewed publicly for the first time in this report, approximately 60 former detainees have ever spoken publicly. [[[See Xinjiang Victims Database <a class=\"fn-ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/shahit.biz\/eng\/#filter\">\u2192<\/a>]]]<\/p><p>Many of the interviews done for this report were arranged with the assistance of two human rights organizations based in Kazakhstan.<\/p><p>Amnesty informed all interviewees about the nature and purpose of the research and about how the information they provided would be used. Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of multiple days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, or Kyrgyz; a few were conducted in English and Mandarin Chinese. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey and remotely in several other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with former detainees and witnesses were conducted individually.<\/p><p>For reasons related to access and the security of the interviewees, no interviews were conducted in Xinjiang either in person or remotely. The government of China threatens, detains, tortures, and forcibly disappears individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Many former detainees and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken publicly on this issue. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews with former camp detainees and other witnesses were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee\u2019s name and\/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee\u2019s family or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. <u>Pseudonyms are used in all cases<\/u>.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Moreover, since only a small number of former internment camp detainees are believed to have left China, and because the Chinese authorities likely know the identity of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very cautious approach to including any information that could be used for the purposes of identification. For example, the report does not mention the specific internment camp where any particular interviewee was detained the specific village or town where that person lived, or the specific age of any of the interviewees, and only rarely does it refer to an interviewee\u2019s occupation.<\/p>","section_id":1205},"section_2":{"type":"section","title":"Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in Xinjiang","content":"<p>The government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China \u2013 particularly former internment camp detainees \u2013 have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in Xinjiang. There is only the remote possibility communicating from Xinjiang over a secure form of communication, and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are under heavy surveillance (see section&nbsp;2.3). <strong>Anyone living in Xinjiang who speaks out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, is accused of speaking out, or is affiliated with anyone who has spoken out, risks detention, arrest, imprisonment, torture, and enforced disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.<\/strong><\/p><p>The risks are particularly severe for ex-detainees and their families, who face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-detainees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance. Before being released, every former internment camp detainee who spoke with Amnesty was made to sign a document that forbade them from speaking with anybody \u2013 especially journalists and foreign nationals \u2013 about what they experienced in the camp.

These acts are in turn usually followed by heavy-handed repression.<\/p><p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. [[[During the first three decades of the PRC, resettlement of Han Chinese into Xinjiang was facilitated by what is now called the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (commonly known as the Bingtuan), an institution established in the early 1950s. The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize Xinjiang, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of Xinjiang, separating the north, where most of the Kazakhs in Xinjiang live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land, and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from the Xinjiang regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons. For more information See See \u201cNew Ghosts Old Ghosts \u2013 Prisons and Labor Reform Camps in China\u201d by James D. Seymour and Richard Anderson, M.E. Sharpe, 1998, p.45. Chapter 3 of the book includes detailed information about the Bingtuan and its network of labour camps and prisons, as well as the separate penal establishments under the Department of Justice of Xinjiang regional government. During the 1990s, the Bingtuan was placed directly under the authority of the central government in Beijing and was granted privileges giving it the same status as Xinjiang regional government (see South China Morning Post, 17 April 1997, and Ming Pao, 28 August 1998).]]] With the massive influx of Han Chinese in recent decades, other ethnic groups have felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land.

An objective of the government\u2019s current campaign appears to be to root out Islamic religious practices and beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours. Ultimately, the government aims to forcibly assimilate members of these ethnic groups into a homogenous Chinese nation possessing a unified language, culture, and unwavering loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party.<\/p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation, the government undertook a campaign of mass detention (see Chapters 3 to 6). The internment camp system is part of a larger campaign of subjugation and forced assimilation of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The government has severely restricted the behaviour of Muslims living in Xinjiang, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp. These restrictions violate multiple human rights, including the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion, and belief; to participate in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination. These violations are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life for millions of members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.<\/p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government\u2019s campaign derive from the government\u2019s unprecedented use of surveillance technology, coupled with its ability to make large portions of the region\u2019s population help it to execute its will.

Ubiquitous government officials, violent security forces, and a non-independent legal system act in concert to conduct the surveillance and enforce rights-violating policies. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been detained, live in constant fear of arrest, detention, and torture under a draconian system of social control that is a constant affront to basic human dignity.<\/p>","section_id":1212},"section_2":{"type":"legal-text","title":"Freedom of religion and the right to take part in cultural life in international law","content":"<p>Freedom of religion or belief is a human right enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, among other international human rights instruments.

These former detainees provided a broadly consistent description of life in the camps. The vast majority of them were detained for between nine and 18 months; many were detained in two or more camps.<\/p><p>Amnesty International used high-resolution satellite imagery to identify the facilities in which some former detainees reported being detained to corroborate their testimony. Baseline imagery from 2016 was used to compare changes from 2017 up to May 2021. Amnesty was able to accurately geolocate 22 camps where 17 former detainees were held. Amnesty was also able to likely locate seven camps where ten former detainees were held. Satellite imagery at the locations described by former detainees from the time the detainees were held displayed new features, including internal fencing, external walls, guard towers, guard posts, people present in compounds, large numbers of cars and buses, and other new and temporary structures. (For more on satellite imagery of the internment camps see section 6.5.)<\/p>","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"Detention conditions","content":"<p>From the moment they entered a camp, detainees\u2019 lives were extraordinarily regimented under conditions that are an affront to human dignity. They were stripped of their personal autonomy, with every aspect of their lives dictated to them. Detainees who deviated from the conduct prescribed by camp authorities \u2013 even in the most seemingly innocuous ways \u2013 were reprimanded and regularly physically punished, often along with their cellmates.<\/p><p>Detainees had no privacy. They were monitored at all times, including when they ate, slept, and used the toilet. They were forbidden to talk freely with other detainees. When detainees were permitted to speak \u2013 to other detainees, guards, or teachers \u2013 they were required to speak in Mandarin Chinese, a language many of them, especially older people and those from more rural areas in Xinjiang, did not speak or understand. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Some detainees were physically punished if they spoke in a language other than Mandarin. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] The camps were set up so that it was impossible to practise religion, and former detainees said any sign of religious practice was punished. \u201cWe can\u2019t even touch our face, or they would suspect us of praying,\u201d Azizbek said. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Detainees were constantly evaluated. According to former detainees, as well as to the leaked government document known as the Telegram, detainees were given scores reflecting their \u201cideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline.\u201d Detainees\u2019 behaviour affected their scores, which in turn factored into the treatment they received in the camp, including \u201crewards, punishments, and family visits\u201d, as well as the timing of their released. [[[The Telegram (previously cited), para. 2.]]]<\/p><p>According to the Telegram, detainees were supposed to be able to communicate regularly with their families. [[[The Telegram (previously cited), para. 13.]]] Some former detainees were indeed able to call home weekly or monthly. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] A few were able to see family members in person a few times during their detention. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Some detainees, though, were never able to call or see their families. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] All calls and interactions were monitored and recorded. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Detainees were coached on what to say to their family members.

[[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] Some women detainees had their hair cut off after arriving, and some men had their heads and beards shaved. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]]<\/p><p>Shortly after being searched, detainees were taken to their cells. Cells in internment camps were basic rooms, usually holding about eight to 20 people. Men and women were detained in separate cells. The cells normally contained two-level or three-level bunkbeds and small stools or chairs. Most detainees had their own bed, but some shared a bed. A few former detainees stated that all people in their cell shared one large bed, known as a <em>kang<\/em>, which was on the ground, and that people were packed \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d. A few former detainees stated that when there were more people than beds, some people slept on the floor. There is usually a TV in the cell and often a Chinese flag on the wall. Windows, if they existed, were barred and usually blacked out. There was a loudspeaker in the room through which camp staff spoke to detainees. There were several closed-circuit television cameras \u2013 usually four \u2013 in each cell. Cells often had lists of camp rules and \u201ccrimes\u201d hanging on the wall. Most detainees reported that the lights in the cell remained on at all times, including during the night.<\/p><p>Cell doors often had two holes, one for the guards stationed in the hallway to look in and another to pass food through. Cell doors were often positioned so that detainees could not see any other rooms from their door. The door to the cell was chained to the wall. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] Nurislam told Amnesty International how humiliating it was to go under the chain every time he needed to leave the cell. \u201cThe door is just half open.

[[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] Detainees were required to wear uniforms corresponding to their classification. According to the majority of former detainees Amnesty interviewed, those in the normal management classification had blue uniforms, those in strict management had yellow uniforms, and those in very strict management had red. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] A detainee\u2019s classification could be adjusted in accordance with their \u201cperformance and point situation [that is, their score]\u201d. [[[The Telegram (previously cited), para. 14.]]] According to leaked government documents, being placed in the normal management group was a necessary condition for being released from the camp (for more on criteria for release see section 6.1).

[[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] According to a former detainee who also worked in a camp, the normal management group was for \u201cordinary crimes\u201d, such as having prohibited software on your phone; strict management was for \u201ccrimes\u201d related to religion; and very strict management was for imams and for people who had previously been convicted of \u201cserious crimes\u201d. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Some former detainees believed the classification system was, at least in part, based on a detainee\u2019s ethnicity, because Uyghurs were much more likely to be placed in one of the stricter categories. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]]<\/p><p>Former detainees stated that they observed differently classified detainees being treated differently. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] \u201cI saw men from the strictest group\u2026 They looked terrible\u2026 I saw some whose toenails were missing,\u201d Aisha said. Arnur, a detainee who also worked in the camp for part of the time she was interned, described some of the differences in treatment she observed, especially related to detainees\u2019 ability to move around the camp and to communicate with family members.<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cMost of the people in the strict management group were there for being religious clerics or somehow involved with religion\u2026 I know this because interrogations [for detainees] sometimes took place in the staff room where [I spent time]\u2026 [In the camp I worked in,] the normal management group learned Chinese and were allowed to walk in the yard; the strict [were allowed to] sit on their beds [some of the time]; and the very strict learned in their cell, were not allowed to move [from their cell], and never got fresh air\u2026 The normal group got to make a call once a week and the strict group once every two weeks and visits once a month\u2026 The very strict group was not permitted to have visitors.\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]]<\/blockquote><p>With two exceptions, all the former detainees Amnesty interviewed were in the normal management category when they arrived in the camp. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] As a result, nearly all the conclusions in this report \u2013 like nearly all the testimonial evidence gathered about the camps from journalists and other organizations \u2013 are based on evidence provided by former detainees who experienced only the normal management treatment. However, given the second-hand accounts about the two stricter categories \u2013 which are observations made by former detainees and staff who were in the same camps as detainees in the stricter categories \u2013 it stands to reason that detainees in the stricter categories were treated much more severely and were much less likely to have been released from a camp and instead remain detained or have been transferred to prison.<\/p><p>Baurzhan, one of the two former detainees Amnesty International spoke with who was in the strict category, was given a yellow uniform for part of his stay. His \u201coffence\u201d was related to religion, also suggesting that he was likely in the strict management category during that time. Some of his treatment appears to have been demonstrably worse than that experience by detainees in the normal management category: He was detained for over two years, was not allowed to call family members when others in his camp not detained for religious crimes were, he was never allowed out of his cell, and his feet were continuously shackled together for several months. \u201cFor two years, my family didn\u2019t know if I was alive or dead,\u201d Baurzhan told Amnesty.

With the exception of a few former detainees describing the portion of their detention that took place in early 2017, every detainee stated that nearly every aspect of their lives in the camps was prescribed, including the position in which they sat, when they stood, and where they looked, and that this was true for every minute of the day. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Khaina, who said she was detained for having WhatsApp on her phone, told Amnesty International how strict the schedule was and how physically draining each day was:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cIt was like a prison\u2026 [Every day] you got up at 5am and had to make your bed, and it had to be perfect.

The classes were mostly about Chinese language, history, law, and \u201cideology\u201d. Some involved memorizing and reciting red songs. The typical schedule included three or four hours of class after breakfast. Then detainees had lunch and a short \u201crest\u201d, which often involved sitting still on a stool or with their heads still on their desks. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] After lunch there was another three or four hours of classes and then dinner, followed by a few hours to sit or kneel on a stool and silently \u201creview\u201d the day\u2019s material or to watch more \u201ceducational\u201d videos. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] At nearly all times during classes, detainees were required to look straight ahead and not to speak with their classmates.<\/p><p>Classes were usually held in classrooms outside the cells. Inmates from two or more cells were regularly brought together in one larger class with approximately 50 people. Former detainees also reported having classes in their cell.<\/p><p>Detainees often had to line up or sit and wait for hours in the morning because of the logistical constraints of transferring thousands of people from cells to classrooms, especially when they had to walk through narrow fenced enclosures \u2013 in essence cages \u2013 to get from the building where their cells were to the building where the classrooms were. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Aibek told Amnesty he spent a large portion of the day waiting to be escorted to class: \u201cAfter classes started, we got moving at 6am. It took two to three hours to send all inmates to class. The class was 1km away. The cage line, beginning from the dorm [and leading] to the class, was really narrow and we could only walk single file.

Meryemg\u00fcl, who said she had been sent to a camp because she refused to work for the government, told Amnesty she remembered a staff member speaking about the two yellow lines on the floor of the camp.

Here you will learn to go inside the path.\u2019\u201d [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Detainees were escorted to class by guards. Some guards had shields and electric batons. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] When travelling from the cell to the classroom, detainees sometime walked outside to another building but were almost always in some sort of caged enclosure. \u201cThe roads from the dorm to the classroom were surrounded by wires and armed guards who looked like they were ready to shoot you,\u201d Aibek said. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Detainees were often required to march to class in a military-type formation, shouting slogans. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Meryemg\u00fcl told Amnesty that inmates were required to march to and from class \u201clike soldiers\u201d and that while marching they were required to shout, \u201cStudy hard, elevate yourself, eliminate separatist forces, and long live Xi Jinping!\u201d [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>The teacher and guards entered the classroom using one door and the students entered through another, which, like the cell doors, was chained to the wall. Classes began and ended with the class thanking the teacher for their sacrifice. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Students and teachers were physically separated at all times. Classrooms had a hard plastic, wooden, or metal divider, over a metre high, separating the students from the teachers and guards. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] A wire or metal screen often filled the space above the divider. Some former detainees and one person who worked as a guard at a camp reported that there were multiple guards with weapons in the classroom with them at all times. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] \u201c[In my class] there were three guards on the same side as the teacher.

[[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Former detainees reported being given short pencils to write with, or only the plastic tube of ink and tip from a disposable pen; they presumed this was because a full-size pencil or a pen could be used as a weapon. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Kanat described his experience in the classroom:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cEvery day was almost the same\u2026 We were brought to a place where you had to sit for 17 hours.

The guards were on the teacher\u2019s side. They taught us verses from Confucius. We had to read [the verses] out loud and repeat them hundreds of times. And there were loudspeakers in the classroom.

Former detainees reported people being taken out of class and beaten or otherwise punished if they did not sit straight and look straight ahead. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Meryemgul told Amnesty International that failure to sit straight could also affect a detainee\u2019s score: \u201cWe had to sit straight with our hands behind our back. In our classroom, there were old women. Their hands and feet swelled up. If you missed your home, if you cried, they would deduct from your score \u2013 they gave scores to everyone \u2013 and they would say that your mind still had problems, that your ideas hadn\u2019t changed.\u201d [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p>","section_id":1242},"section_10":{"type":"section","title":"Language training","content":"<p>Teaching Chinese was a primary objective of the \u201ceducation\u201d that detainees received in the camps.

[[[Amnesty International interview.]]] These classes were often taught by government officials or delivered on video by state-approved imams talking about religion, or judges and lawyers speaking about what the state classified as \u201cterrorism\u201d, \u201cextremism\u201d, and \u201cseparatism\u201d.

What do your parents do?\u2019 I said I only stayed with family, that I took care of livestock, and that I didn\u2019t do anything illegal\u2026 they asked me about mosque and praying\u2026 If I told them I had been praying, I had heard that I would get sentenced for 20 or 25 years. So I told them I never prayed. Then they became upset. They said, \u2018All that time with livestock, you became an animal too!\u2019 Then they hit me with a chair until it broke\u2026 I fell to the floor. I almost fainted\u2026 Then they put me on the chair again. They said, \u2018this guy hasn\u2019t changed yet, he needs to stay [in the camp] longer\u2019\u2026 then they radioed the guards, who helped me back to the cell.\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/blockquote><p>Mansur was also sent to two punishment rooms on multiple occasions for trivial offenses.<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201c[The first time I was taken in the first camp] it was because I tried to look out the window. There was a window with a bar [in my cell]. We were not allowed to look outside\u2026 [The first time I was sent in the second camp] was because they made me the responsible person for the cell. Leaders were inspecting the cell. When they came in [to inspect our cell] we had to stand up and show respect but my cell didn\u2019t do it, so I was sent to a punishment room\u2026 [The second time I was sent to the punishment room in the second camp] was one day before I was released. It was because I didn\u2019t sit still in the classroom.\u201d<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>Mansur was tortured in both camps. He told Amnesty he was repeatedly electrocuted while being asked repetitively whether he \u201cwould do it again\u201d. \u201c[I had to say that] I made a mistake but will not do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time they electric shocked me. Then they tied me up on a chair for 24 hours without food or water\u2026 The second time they chained me up [from the wall].\u201d He told Amnesty he was left immobilized in a tiger chair multiple times, and the room was very cold. \u201cThey would open the window on winter days,\u201d he said. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Mansur also described two of the punishment rooms, one of which had 20 tiger chairs.<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cYou can see the chair across from you, but not beside you because there are [wooden] dividers [that go to the ceiling]\u2026 Above every tiger chair there is a camera and microphone and a small white light.

You could not see the chair beside you\u2026 There was another person in front of me [who I could see]\u2026 When the guard left, I asked the man in front of me how long he had been there. He said 24 hours.\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/blockquote><p>Solitary confinement was used in the camps as a form of punishment. In some cases, this punishment could include confinement in tiger chairs, with the person immobilized in the chair left alone for close to a day or longer. In one case, a former detainee stated that the camp she was interned in had a \u201cdark\u201d, tomb-like room, which was windowless and without light, about two metres by one metre, where detainees were sent if they misbehaved. She told Amnesty she was put in the room for two days:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cOn that day a 70-year-old lady spoke her mother tongue, Uyghur, in our cell\u2026 The guards wanted to take her to a tiger chair. I argued with them\u2026 They said that I hadn\u2019t learned and still had extremist thoughts, so they put me in the dark room\u2026 It\u2019s just a room for one person. I was just lying on the floor\u2026 When you lie down [with your head at one end] your feet almost touch the wall\u2026 There is a toilet in the room, nothing else.\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/blockquote><p>Physical ill-treatment also takes place throughout the camps outside of interrogation and \u201cformal\u201d punishments, most commonly through beatings, the use of restraints, and the use of pepper spray. Guards routinely beat detainees who \u201cmisbehave\u201d, even for the most trivial offences. Amnesty International interviewed numerous people who reported being beaten during detention. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Electric batons were often used to electrocute and beat people. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Madi told Amnesty how he was beaten shortly after arriving at the camp when he resisted being strip-searched by guards:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cWhen I said I wouldn\u2019t take off my underwear they beat me with an electric baton. And then I fell. They beat me and I was electrocuted\u2026 When I came to my senses, they took off my clothes, they searched me, made me bend down, tied my hands behind my neck. It was very painful.\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/blockquote><p>Amir told Amnesty he was severely beaten after fighting back against a guard who hit him with a rifle:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201c[One of the guards] said, \u2018Squat and put your hands on the back of your head!\u2019\u2026 I asked why. Then the police hit me with the back of a rifle\u2026 I wanted to protect myself, so I hit back. He fell down. Then the other police all hit me. When I was being beaten up, I heard one voice saying, \u2018End him with one bullet\u2019\u2026 I thought I was going to die\u2026 I wanted not to be killed and I screamed\u2026 Then they sprayed something in my eyes so I couldn\u2019t open them\u2026 Then I was dragged [to my cell].\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/blockquote><p>Two former detainees reported having their legs shackled during part of their time in detention. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Rustam told Amnesty his legs were shackled for 15 days after he was initially detained. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Baurzhan told Amnesty his feet were shackled together for the first year he was in a camp.<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cIt was a metal chain with 11 links. The two ends were on my feet with bolts. [It weighed about] 3kg. We could barely step 20cm or more. I could barely walk. It was on 24\/7. Every week the guards would check the chain. Every two weeks they would tighten the bolts\u2026 [Several months after I arrived in the camp] they offered us water for showering, but always with the chain on. The old inmates showed us how to take your pants off. We took our pants off through the space between the chain and ankle, but it takes a really long time.\u201d<\/strong> [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/blockquote><p>Three former detainees told Amnesty International that they were sprayed with something, likely pepper spray, while they were in the camps. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Amir told Amnesty he was sprayed with something while being interrogated twice while immobilized in a tiger chair. \u201cI was taken [from my cell] to another room and seated in a tiger chair\u2026 they didn\u2019t ask me anything. They sprayed something in the air that made it difficult to breathe. [The spray] was small, like [the size] of a bottle of pills. You could put it in your pocket,\u201d he said. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Madi told Amnesty that guards used to spray a white substance, which he believed was pepper spray, into his cell frequently \u2013 multiple times a day \u2013 which made his throat sore and made it difficult to breathe.

Like the process surrounding the initial detention and transfer to the internment camp, much of the release process appears to be operating outside of the scope of the Chinese criminal justice system or other domestic law. There is a total absence of any transparent criteria or legal assistance and protection. Nothing that former detainees experienced during the time leading up to their release indicates any regard for the fairness and due process required by the gravity of deciding individuals\u2019 fates.<\/p><p>Leaked Chinese government documents, particularly the Telegram, provide some insight into how the government intended \u2013 at least at one point \u2013 the release process to work. [[[The Telegram (previously cited), para 17.]]] Based on testimony from former detainees and witnesses and on what we know from the Telegram, the decision to release or transfer someone is essentially the culmination of a process that begins when an individual is first detained. From that moment, there is an ongoing process of monitoring and evaluation, whereby people are given scores. A detainee\u2019s behaviour reportedly affects their score, which factors into the release determination.<\/p><p>According to the Telegram, once a detainee arrives at an internment camp there are five broad criteria that must be met to be designated as ready to be <em>considered<\/em> for release from the camp. The detainee must have<\/p><ol type=\"1\">\n<li><p>been placed in the normal management group;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>been in the camp for at least a year;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>displayed some form of improvement with respect to their \u201cproblem\u201d since arriving in the camp;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>achieved adequate scores with respect to \u201cideological transformation, academic achievement, compliance and discipline, etc.\u201d; and<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>no \u201cother circumstances that affect completion\u201d.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Once these criteria are met, a detainee can proceed to the first of several additional evaluations undertaken by camp and other government officials. First, \u201ca student evaluation team overseen by the Party organization secretary\u201d undertakes a \u201cpreliminary\u201d evaluation and then checks the Integrated Joint Operations Platform to see if it has flagged any \u201cnew problems\u201d. Then, in the absence of any new issues flagged by IJOP, the case is reported \u201cup level-by-level\u201d to three different groups of government cadres, the last of which is the \u201clocal (prefecture or city) vocational skills education and training service bureau\u201d that, in concert with \u201ccomrades of the local [Party] committee\u201d, makes the final determination about whether the detainee is ready for \u201ccompletion\u201d and ultimately release. [[[The Telegram (previously cited), para. 18.]]]<\/p><p>It is also plausible that the decisions to release individual detainees were based on factors unrelated to the criteria described in the Telegram. According to reports from former detainees interviewed by Amnesty and other organizations, the criteria in the Telegram were not always adhered to. For example, a significant number of detainees have been released without being in a camp for a year.

[[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Aiman, a government cadre who assigned scores to families in her village, told Amnesty how cadres also scored family members of people in internment camps and said that family members were told that if they went to work in specific factories or attended Chinese language classes it would increase their scores. Although Aiman was personally sceptical that detainees were ever released early because of good behaviour by their family members, she was instructed to inform family that it could. Moreover, according to Aiman, when men were sent to camps, authorities would pressure their wives to work in factories:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cIf [a woman] refused, then they threatened that her husband\u2019s situation would be worse\u2026 Under my supervision there were [a few dozen] women who were taken to factories like this.

For example, if parents were sent then it affected the son \u2013 he could not get a job with government or police\u2026 Also, for example, the cadres staying with [the families of people in camps] overnight had to report back to the village committee if anyone prayed. And if they found this, then the score [of the person in the camp] would be lowered<em>\u2026<\/em> And if a person was sent to re-education camp then that person\u2019s family had to attend classes.

Moreover, it is plausible that many of the detainees were released because of a policy change with respect to certain ethnic minority groups only \u2013 in particular, ethnic Kazakhs.

But it is not known if this is because Uyghurs have not been released or because, with very few exceptions, they have been unable to travel to foreign countries where they are willing and able to speak relatively freely about their detention, or even to share information about their release. Several of the Kazakh former detainees Amnesty interview said that Uyghurs were less likely to be released than Kazakhs and the vast majority of the people they know of who were released from their camps were Kazakh, even though Uyghurs made up the overwhelming majority of the camp populations in many of those camps.

Many were informed that their release was predicated on achieving certain targets, such as learning a sufficient number of Chinese characters. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Many also understood that breaking any camp rules would likely prolong their detention.<\/p><p>Despite their awareness of being evaluated, very few former detainees credited their release to anything they did or did not do in the camps. Most attributed their release to factors largely or entirely outside their control, such as their Kazakh ethnicity and the fact that the government decided to release ethnic Kazakhs from the camps. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] Some believe they were released because of appeals for their release made by family members living abroad. [[[Amnesty International interviews.]]] Others have no idea why they were released. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] \u201cThey released 12 people the day I was released\u2026 They said, \u2018Your time is up and you can go home now.\u2019 They didn\u2019t say why. They just released Kazakhs, not Hui or Uyghurs,\u201d Asylbek told Amnesty International. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Some former detainees also believed their release was connected to the reason they were initially detained; those detained for certain \u201ccrimes\u201d \u2013 especially religion-related offences \u2013 were believed to be much less likely to be released. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] This would be consistent with several other aspects of the mass incarceration campaign and the internment camp system. Because those sent to camps for religious reasons were generally placed in the \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cvery strict\u201d management categories, it stands to reason that at the very least, it would take longer for them to progress from either of those categories into the \u201cnormal\u201d management category, which, according to the Telegram, is a prerequisite for release.<\/p><p>The interviews and other procedural steps former detainees have described undergoing before being released are broadly consistent with the process outlined in the Telegram. Many of the former detainees were questioned by camp and other government officials before release, often by several groups of officials from different government bodies. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]] According to Nurgul, who said she was detained for having WhatsApp on her phone, the release procedure involved officials from several levels of government. \u201cIt\u2019s like a parole hearing. Civil servants came to camp. They checked my documents, asked whether I improved, whether my family was complying. They asked your friends and your neighbours if you were reliable,\u201d she said. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>The questions asked in these pre-release interviews followed a similar script. Detainees were asked about their religious practices, their contacts abroad, and other topics they had been questioned about repeatedly throughout their internment. Nearly all detainees were required to \u201cconfess\u201d to their \u201ccrimes\u201d, to acknowledge that their past behaviour was wrong, to express how much they appreciated the education they had received, to explain how their thoughts had been \u201ctransformed\u201d, to swear they would not act that way again, and, often, to disavow Islam. Detainees were also required to explain what they were planning to do after they were released. [[[Amnesty International interview.]]]<\/p><p>Former detainees believed that to be released they needed to answer all the questions in the way the government officials wanted, regardless of whether it was the truth. Aitugan told Amnesty that in the weeks before his release, he was interviewed by four different groups of government officials \u2013 \u201cschool\u201d level (that is, camp level), county level, prefecture level, and autonomous region level \u2013 all of whom asked him similar questions and, he believes, required certain answers:<\/p><blockquote><strong>\u201cAll the [interviews] were the same.

The restrictions on the right to freedom of expression described in Chapter&nbsp;2 also go beyond what is legitimate and proportionate.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Equality and non-discrimination:<\/strong> Testimony that former residents of Xinjiang and other witnesses provided to Amnesty demonstrates a policy of discriminating against Muslim minorities. The testimony also shows restrictions on human rights documented in this report enforced in a discriminatory manner. As an illustration, former detainees said the police stopped only members of ethnic minorities on the street or at checkpoints, where they were subjected to ID checks and body searches; Han Chinese either did not need to go through the checkpoints at all or were essentially waved through without having their bodies or phones searched and without being questioned. Furthermore, Han Chinese were not compelled to attend flag-raising ceremonies or to attend \u201ceducation\u201d classes.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><blockquote>\n<p>The state also fails to protect against discrimination by third parties. For example, members of ethnic minority groups faced much greater difficulty accessing public transport and commercial entities such as hotels and shops. Taken as a whole, the treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups runs starkly counter to the state\u2019s duties to eliminate, prevent, and remedy discrimination \u2013 not only by its own officials but also by private individuals and other non-state actors \u2013 and to take positive steps to address longstanding disadvantages that those groups experience.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","section_id":1275}},"chapter_id":1271},"chapter_9":{"type":"chapter","title":"Conclusions ","content":"<p>Since 2017, under the guise of a campaign against \u201cterrorism\u201d, the government of China has carried out massive and systematic abuses against millions of Muslims living in the Xinjiang. The human suffering has been immense. The abuses are ongoing.<\/p><p>Chinese authorities initially denied the existence of this campaign. Then, perhaps because mounting evidence made outright denial indefensible, they advanced other explanations; for example, that Muslims were participating in a voluntary \u201ceducation\u201d or \u201ctraining\u201d programme. They also provided quasi-legal justifications for their actions as being a legitimate response to \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cextremism\u201d. Moreover, the government has devoted \u2013 and continues to devote \u2013 tremendous resources to concealing the truth about its actions. It prevents millions of people living in Xinjiang from communicating freely about the situation, denies journalists and investigators meaningful access to the region, stages tours for those who do enter, and forcibly enlists members of the affected population to parrot its falsehoods.<\/p><p>The government\u2019s descriptions of its actions are demonstrably false, its justifications are legally and morally untenable, and its attempted cover-up should fool no one. Muslims in Xinjiang are not free to practise their religion, they are persecuted because of it; nobody chose to go to an internment camp, they were arbitrarily detained; the camps were not designed to \u201ceducate\u201d under any reasonable understanding of the term, they were designed to erase people\u2019s cultural identities. Human rights violations of this nature are not legally permissible under <em>any<\/em> circumstance, and no reasonable assessment could consider them a proportionate response to the purported threat of terrorism. The government\u2019s attempts to hide these truths have come straight from the propagandist\u2019s playbook. Its staged tours and forced testimonies lack even an air of plausibility. They reveal nothing other than tremendous fear.<\/p><p>The Chinese authorities\u2019 fabrications notwithstanding, the world now knows a significant amount about what has been occurring in Xinjiang. Credible documentary, testimonial, and photographic evidence has revealed certain inescapable facts: the human rights violations have been massive in scale, methodically carried out by government officials at all levels throughout Xinjiang, and directed at parts of the population not because of anything unlawful they did but rather because of who they are and because of their beliefs and their culture. This has been nothing less than a whole-of-government effort to trample on the human rights of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups: to persecute, to detain, and to torture. The government\u2019s ongoing efforts to conceal its actions should cause the world to draw only adverse inferences about what else may have occurred and what else may still be occurring.<\/p><p>The government of China is responsible to prevent, stop, investigate, and punish any suspected serious violations of international human rights and to ensure reparations to victims. Given the government\u2019s unwillingness to halt its own violations, let alone to conduct impartial and thorough investigations and prosecute those suspected to be criminally responsible, the international community has a duty to take steps to protect human rights, investigate the crimes, and ensure accountability.<\/p><p>It has been four years since the internment camps opened in Xinjiang and the international community has done little to help the affected population. The UN has failed to fulfil its responsibilities to the people of Xinjiang. There are a number of avenues by which \u201cthe UN\u201d could take steps to hold China to account. UN member states could take concrete action to address the situation \u2013 to convene special sessions and launch robust investigations \u2013 through the Security Council, the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council. Not only have they failed to do so, but a significant number of states continue to use their platform at these forums to defend China\u2019s human rights record in Xinjiang and beyond. The UN Secretariat \u2013 led by the Secretary-General, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \u2013 could also take action independently of decisions by UN member states, to conduct remote monitoring and publish the details of its findings to set the record straight, as it has done in other situations. So far, its public statements have been muted and it has done no public reporting.<\/p><p>The failure of the UN to take decisive action to address these egregious and well-documented human rights violations, and to hold China to account for its actions, is a stain on the institution\u2019s reputation and a failure on many counts to fulfil clear mandates to address human rights situations of concern on their merits. By turning a blind eye to the suffering of millions of people in Xinjiang, the UN has effectively contributed to China\u2019s efforts to discredit the survivors and activists who have spoken out at significant personal risk, and to dehumanize the affected population. The UN and its member states must urgently remedy this situation.<\/p><p>Amnesty International interviewed a Han Chinese man who travelled to Xinjiang after 2017. During his time there, he spoke with a Muslim friend who told him that what was happening to Muslims in Xinjiang was worse than what was being reported in the news. When this man asked his friend why he did not speak out about the situation, the friend replied: \u201cLet\u2019s survive first.\u201d His silence was understandable. But unlike members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups living in Xinjiang, the rest of the world has no legitimate excuse not to speak out, to try to uncover the truth, to make every effort to end the violations, and to ensure accountability for the crimes. The people of Xinjiang deserve this, at the very least.<\/p>","sections":{},"chapter_id":1276},"chapter_10":{"type":"chapter","title":"Recommendations","content":"","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"To the Government of China","content":"<ul>\n<li><p>Immediately release all persons held in internment camps or other detention facilities \u2013 including prisons \u2013 in Xinjiang, unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognized offence, are transferred to recognized detention facilities, and are granted a fair trial in line with international standards.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Allow all those held to legally challenge their continued detention.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Provide the family members of people who are detained in camps, prisons, or other detention facilities \u2013 including those living abroad \u2013 with written reasons for their detention and other official documentation related to their family member\u2019s case.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Close the \u201cvocational training\u201d, \u201ctransformation-through-education\u201d, and \u201cde-extremification\u201d centres (that is, the internment camps) in Xinjiang.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li><p>Ensure that no person is subjected to arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, or torture or other ill-treatment.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Pending their release, ensure that all persons brought into or detained in these camps have prompt and regular access to a lawyer of their choice, to independent medical personnel, and to their families.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Ensure that everyone in Xinjiang is able to freely communicate with family members and others, including those living in other countries, unless specific restrictions on such communication can be justified under international human rights law.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Repeal or amend all laws and regulations, and end all related policies and practical measures, that impermissibly restrict the human rights of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including the right to freely leave and return to China.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Allow everyone, including Muslims and members of all other religious or belief-based communities, to choose and keep their religion or beliefs, and to manifest these peacefully through worship, observance, practice, and teaching, both publicly and privately.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Ensure that any legal provisions aimed at protecting national security or created in the name of counter-terrorism are clearly and narrowly defined and conform to international human rights law and standards.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Conduct impartial, independent, prompt, effective, and transparent investigations of any person reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, or other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

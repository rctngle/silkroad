{"chapter_1":{"type":"chapter","title":"Executive Summary","content":"<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim peoples living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and persecution. In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses against these peoples. An objective of the government\u2019s campaign is to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to \u201ctransform\u201d members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.<\/p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and cultural erasure, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment and forced assimilation. More than a million men and women \u2013 Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, Tajiks, and Hui\u2013 have been arbitrarily detained in what the government refers to as \u201cvocational training centres\u201d or \u201ctransformation through education\u201d centres, but which are more accurately described as internment camps. In these camps, detainees are subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.<\/p><p>The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour of ethnic minorities outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, peaceful assembly, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.<\/p><p>The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up it abuses in Xinjiang and, in particular, to prevent foreigners from obtaining information about the internment camps. The whereabouts of many of the people sent to internment camps is not known. Many remain in indefinite incommunicado detention in the camps. Hundreds of thousands have been transferred to situations of forced labour or given long prison sentences. Those who have been permitted to return to their homes do so under strict conditions limiting their movement and associations.<\/p><p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government\u2019s campaign \u2013 and the associated cover-up \u2013 derive from the government\u2019s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic monitories is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert \u2013 along with a substantial portion of the civilian population who have been terrorized into complicity \u2013 to conduct the surveillance, enforce illegal policies, and administer the internment camps, prisons, and forced labour. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their basic human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.<\/p><p>This report details human rights violations committed by the Government of China in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2021. The findings are based primarily on first-hand testimonial evidence from XX survivors and witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International, XX of whom had never shared their stories publicly before. The report also draws on leaked government documents and a substantial body of public reporting by journalists and other investigators. Evidence demonstrates that the Government of China knowingly and purposefully targeted ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including by unlawful restriction of their basic human rights, as well as by an ethnically targeted campaign of mass detention, and torture and other ill treatment. The government\u2019s actions evince a clear intent to target certain populations collectively on the basis of their ethnicity and religion and to use serious violence and intimidation to outlaw their religious practices and eradicate their ethno-cultural identify. On the basis of the evidence gathered by Amnesty International and from other sources that Amnesty has concluded to be credible, this report concludes that the Government of China has committed serious violations of international human rights law and international criminal law, including crimes against humanity.<\/p><p>The report has 12 chapters:<\/p><ul>\n<li><p>Chapter 2 describes the research methodology and details the obstacles to conducting human rights research in Xinjiang.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 3 provides background information Xinjiang and gives an overview of the cycles of violence, discrimination, and repression that occurred in Xinjiang from the 1980s to 2016.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 4 describes major human rights violations in Xinjiang since 2017 that have occurred outside the camps, including the severe restrictions on freedom of religion, freedom of movement, and privacy.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 5 focuses on what happens to detainees from the time they are detained until they enter an internment camp: the process of arbitrary detention, interrogation, biometric data collection, and transfer to a camp.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chapter 6 details life for detainees inside the internment camps, including the conditions in the camps, the highly regimented daily routines, and the content of the \u201cre-education\u201d curriculum.

Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of two days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz; a few were conducted in English. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey and remotely in XX other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with survivors and witnesses were conducted individually.<\/p><p>For reasons related to the security of the potential interviewees, no interviews were conducted in Xinjiang either in person or remotely. The Government of China threatens, detainees, tortures, and \u201cdisappears\u201d individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Many survivors and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken with Amnesty International. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee\u2019s name and\/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee\u2019s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Moreover, since only a small number of internment camp survivors (likely a few hundred) are believed to have left China, and because the government likely knows the identify of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very conservative approach to including any information that could be identifying. For example, none of the testimony in this report is associated with a specific internment camp where an interviewee was detained or with a specific village or town where an interviewee lived, and only rarely with a specific age or occupation of the interviewee.<\/p>","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in Xinjiang","content":"<p>The Government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China \u2013 particularly internment camp survivors \u2013 have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in Xinjiang. The possibility of speaking from Xinjiang over a genuinely secure form of communication is remote and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are under heavy surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Anyone living in Xinjiang who does speak out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, or is accused of speaking out risks arrest, detention, imprisonment, torture, and disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.<\/p><p>The risks are even more severe for ex-detainees and their families, who already face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-internees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Every internment camp survivor who spoke with Amnesty signed a document that forbid them from speaking with anybody \u2013 especially journalists and foreigners \u2013 about what they experienced in the camp. The document reportedly specifies that if they violate this prohibition they will be interned again, along with members of their family (see Chapter&nbsp;X).<\/p><p>As a result of the obstacles and risks facing people in Xinjiang, with few exceptions the vast majority of credible testimonial evidence about the situation has been gathered from survivors and witnesses who have left Xinjiang and spoken from abroad. Speaking from abroad is also difficult and comes with serious risks, especially for family members of the person speaking who remain in China. Since at least 2017, obtaining permission to travel abroad \u2013 and, in many cases, domestically \u2013 has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs, and extraordinarily difficult for other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Members of ethnic minority groups who have obtained permission to travel abroad since 2017 appear to require a connection to a foreign country (usually citizenship or immediate family) and one or more \u201cguarantors\u201d in Xinjiang who agree, in writing, that they will be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing speaks or shares information about the internment camps or does not return to China on time. As documented in this report and elsewhere, these are not empty threats: family members of people who speak about the issue from abroad have been sent to internment camps and in some cases disappeared (see Chapter&nbsp;X).<\/p><p>Independent journalists and human rights investigators have all been denied unfettered access to the region. A few have entered disguised as tourists but have found it nearly impossible to speak safely with people about the internment camps. [[[Cite PBS and Vice]]] Those who have travelled to the region officially have encountered a coordinated effort by government officials to block them from speaking with survivors and witnesses and from accessing internment camps, except in situations where the government tries to exercise complete control over where they visit, who they speak with, and what is said to them. [[[Cite Channel 4, BBC, etc]]]<\/p><p>Reporting about the situation from abroad also carries significant risk. In several instances, when journalists with family in Xinjiang have reported on or spoken about the situation in Xinjiang from abroad, family members have been arrested, sent to a camp or prison, or disappeared. [[[Add in examples from RFA and others, and from our campaign \u201ccases\u201d]]]<\/p><p>Chinese government officials have also made a concerted effort to disseminate misinformation and disinformation, both to foreigners and to the local population, about the human rights situation in Xinjiang.

[[[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Xinjiang]]] The area comprises vast semi-desert steppes in the north and severe desert basins ringed by historic oasis towns in the south.<\/p><p>The XUAR is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. According to China\u2019s 2010 census the region had a population of approximately 22 million. More than half of the region\u2019s population belongs to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million), Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and other populations whose languages, cultures, and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han, who are the majority in \u201cinterior\u201d China.<\/p><p>The area covered by the XUAR was renowned over centuries for the ancient Silk Road and its flourishing conduit of trade and culture between China and the rest of the world. Rich in coal, natural gas, and oil, the XUAR is intertwined with many of China\u2019s economic, strategic, and foreign policy goals. China\u2019s leaders now consider stability in the XUAR vital to the success of the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d, a massive global infrastructure development programme aimed at strengthening China\u2019s links to Central Asia and beyond.<\/p><p>The XUAR is one of the five autonomous regions of the PRC, where the officially recognized \u201cnational minorities\u201d are granted some formal representation in the organs of regional government. The autonomy conferred to these regions by the PRC Constitution and Law on Regional Autonomy has remained largely symbolic. In the XUAR, as in the rest of the PRC, all major policy decisions are taken by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<\/p><p>The Government of China considers the XUAR to have been an inseparable part of China for millennia. But this history is disputed by many, particularly Uyghurs, who often perceive China as a colonizing force and aspire to independence. Aspirations towards independence have their roots in both the distant past and recent history. During the 1930s and 1940s, two independent Republics of Eastern Turkestan were formed successively in Kashgar (1933) and Ili (1944) as attempts to resist Chinese rule. [[[See Linda Benson, \u201cThe Ili Rebellion: The Moslem Challenge to Chinese Authority in Xinjiang, 1944-1949\", M.E. Sharpe, New York, 1990; and Dru C.

Over the years, various opposition groups militating for Eastern Turkestan\u2019s independence were formed clandestinely in the XUAR. Some of these groups have resorted to violence (see below).<\/p><p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. In 1949, the local Turkic population, in majority Uyghur, accounted for at least 93% of the region\u2019s population, while ethnic Chinese in the region amounted to about 6 or 7% of the population. According to official statistics, Han Chinese now make up approximately 40% of the population. With the massive influx of Han Chinese, the indigenous population has felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land.

The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize Xinjiang, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of the XUAR, separating the north, where most Kazakhs in Xinjiang live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from the XUAR regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons.

Since the late 1980s, the return to restrictive policies and other factors have generated growing ethnic discontent in the XUAR.

While the government had severely restricted the human rights of ethnic minorities for decades (see Chapter 3 above), the new restrictions were dramatically more severe than anything imposed previously. An objective of the government\u2019s campaign is to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to \u201ctransform\u201d members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.<\/p><p>To achieve this political indoctrination and cultural erasure, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment. More than a million men and women have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps (see Chapter X). The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation and forced assimilation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy.

Regarding certain crimes described in this report, in particular torture, exercising universal jurisdiction over perpetrators is a legal obligation, not a choice.

As of March 2021, 170 states are party to this Convention, including China.]]]<\/p><p>[Insert number] of members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been the victims of the government\u2019s widespread and systematic attack in furtherance of a state policy \u2013 in this case as part of the Chinese government\u2019s campaigns to eradicate \u201cterrorism, extremism, and separatism\u201d and to forcibly assimilate ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.<\/p><p>Specifically, Amnesty International has concluded that the contextual elements have been met for the the following five crimes:<\/p><ul>\n<li><p>Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law, including through the arbitrary detention of one million or more men and women in internment camps throughout Xinjiang.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Torture, including the physical torture of a significant portion of the internment camp population by beatings, electric shocks, stress position, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, and solitary confinement. And the physical and non-physical torture of all internment camp detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps. This includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native tongue, living under the constant threat of violence, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Persecution based on ethnic and religious grounds, including through the ethnically-targeted campaign of arbitrary detention, the restriction on freedom to practice Islam, and restriction on freedom of movement for ethnic minorities.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Enforced disappearance of persons, including by the detention of [insert number] of people who the government refuses to give information on about their fate or whereabouts with their families and other concerned parties.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>The survivor testimonies Amnesty International has gathered form the basis of these conclusions; however, these testimonies are corroborated by leaked government documents and other credible testimonial, photographic, and documentary evidence collected by journalists and investigators. Taken together, this evidence clearly illustrates that the serious abuses documented in this report follow a very consistent pattern of criminal conduct and are part of well-documented government policy that is knowingly and purposefully being carried out on a massive scale by government officials all over Xinjiang. As a result, an independent, impartial, and effective criminal investigation is needed to establish individual responsibility for these crimes.<\/p>","sections":{},"chapter_id":376},"chapter_11":{"type":"chapter","title":"Conclusion","content":"<p>Coming soon\u2026<\/p>","sections":{},"chapter_id":377},"chapter_12":{"type":"chapter","title":"Recommendations","content":"","sections":{"section_1":{"type":"section","title":"To the Government of China:","content":"<ul>\n<li><p>Close the political \u201cre-education\u201d camps and release the people detained in these camps immediately and unconditionally.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Immediately allow independent journalists and human rights investigators unfettered access to all of Xinjiang, including to internment camps and prisons.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Repeal or amend all laws and regulations, and end all related measures, that impermissibly restrict the rights of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups and stop using \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d as an excuse to restrict religious and cultural practices.

<p>China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang</p>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Evidence collected by Amnesty International provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the government of China has committed crimes against humanity in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), including the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture, and persecution. This evidence also demonstrates that the government has committed other serious violations of human rights. These include grave violations of the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion, and belief; to take part in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination. These crimes have been directed against members of the region’s predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, and Tajiks.</p>
<p>Muslims living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and persecution. In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying campaign against “terrorism”, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses against these peoples. The government’s actions since 2017 evince a clear intent to target certain populations collectively on the basis of their religion and ethnicity and to use severe violence and intimidation to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minority groups into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
<p>This report is a product of field and remote research carried out between October 2019 and May 2021. The report’s findings and conclusions draw heavily from first-hand testimonies that Amnesty International gathered from survivors of the internment camps and other witnesses who were present in Xinjiang since 2017, as well as from an analysis of satellite imagery and data. The report also draws on testimonial evidence and confidential government documents gathered and analysed by journalists, scholars, and other human rights organizations.</p>
<p>XXX people were interviewed for this report: 52 survivors of internment camps in Xinjiang (XX men and XX women), 15 other witnesses who lived in or visited Xinjiang since 2017, and 75 family members of people from Xinjiang who are currently missing or detained. The interviewees included XX Kazakhs, XX Uyghurs, X Kyrgyz, X Uzbeks, X Tajiks, and X Han Chinese.</p>
<p>40 survivors and 12 witnesses interviewed for this report had never shared their stories publicly before. 7 of the survivors had never shared significant portions of their stories. The survivor testimonies represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation inside the internment camps since 2017. According to the Xinjiang Victims Database – a website run by human rights researchers and activists that aggregates and synthesizes all publicly available testimony related to Xinjiang internment camps – excluding the survivors interviewed in this report, 60 other camp survivors have ever spoken publicly. [[[See XUAR Victims Database, https://shahit.biz/eng/#filter, For other primary accounts of survivors see https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/an-inside-look-at-muslim-reeducation-camps-in-china-a-1238046.html; https://believermag.com/weather-reports-voices-from-XUAR/ ; and https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/09/asia/XUAR-china-kazakhstan-detention-intl/index.html (video of man saying forced to stand for long hours).]]]</p>
<p>Some of the interviews done for this report were arranged with the assistance of two human rights organizations based in Kazakhstan – Atajurt (Атажұрт) [[[Atajurt website]]] and the International Legal Initiative. [[[ILI website]]]</p>
<p>Amnesty informed all interviewees about the nature and purpose of the research and about how the information they provided would be used. Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of two days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz or Uzbek; a few were conducted in English and Mandarin Chinese. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey and remotely in X other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with survivors and witnesses were conducted individually.</p>
<p>For reasons related to the security of the potential interviewees, no interviews were conducted in Xinjiang either in person or remotely. The government of China threatens, detains, tortures, and forcibly disappears individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Many survivors and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken with Amnesty International. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews with camp survivors and other witnesses were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee’s name and/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee’s family or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms are used in all cases.</strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, since only a small number of internment camp survivors are believed to have left China, and because the Chinese authorities likely know the identity of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very conservative approach to including any information that could be used for the purposes of identification. For example, none of the testimony in this report is associated with a specific internment camp where an interviewee was detained or with a specific village or town where an interviewee had lived, and only rarely with a specific age or occupation of the interviewee.</p>
<h2 id="obstacles-to-investigating-the-human-rights-situation-in-xinjiang">Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in Xinjiang</h2>
<p>The government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China – particularly internment camp survivors – have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in Xinjiang. The possibility of communicating from Xinjiang over a secure form of communication is remote and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are under heavy surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). <strong>Anyone living in Xinjiang who does speak out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, is accused of speaking out, or is affiliated with anyone who has spoken out risks detention,</strong> <strong>arrest, imprisonment, torture, and enforced disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.</strong></p>
<p>The risks are even more severe for ex-detainees and their families, who already face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-internees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Before being released, every internment camp survivor who spoke with Amnesty was made to sign a document that forbade them from speaking with anybody – especially journalists and foreigners – about what they experienced in the camp. Camp survivors were informed that if they violated this prohibition they would be interned again, along with members of their families (see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p>
<p>As a result of the obstacles and risks facing people in Xinjiang, with few exceptions the vast majority of credible testimonial evidence about the situation has been gathered from survivors and witnesses who have left Xinjiang and have spoken from abroad. Speaking from abroad is also difficult and comes with serious risks, especially for family members of the person speaking who remain in China. [[[For more on the risks facing people who speak out about the situation from abroad see: Amnesty International, Nowhere Feels Safe: Uyghurs Tell of China-led Intimidation Campaign Abroad, 21 February 2020, www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/02/china-uyghurs-abroad-living-in-fear/.]]] Since at least 2017, obtaining permission to travel abroad – and, in many cases, domestically – has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs and extraordinarily difficult for other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Those who have obtained permission to travel abroad since 2017 appear to require a connection to a foreign country (usually citizenship or immediate family) and one or more “guarantors” in Xinjiang who agree, in writing, that they will be sent to a camp if the person they are guaranteeing speaks or shares information about the internment camps or does not return to China on time. [[[Cite articles about travelling abroad.]]] As documented in this report and elsewhere, these are not empty threats: family members of people who speak about the issue from abroad have been sent to internment camps (see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p>
<p>Independent journalists, human rights investigators, and diplomats have all been denied unfettered access to the region. A few journalists have entered disguised as tourists but have found it nearly impossible to speak safely with people about the internment camps. [[[Cite PBS and Vice]]] Those who have travelled to the region officially have encountered a coordinated effort by government officials to block them from speaking with survivors and witnesses and from accessing internment camps, except in situations where the authorities try to exercise complete control over where they visit, what they see, who they speak with, and what is said to them. [[[Cite Channel 4, BBC, etc]]]</p>
<p>In rare cases when journalists are able to interview people on the ground in Xinjiang, interviewees have subsequently been forced by authorities to retract their stories. In response to a recent case Amnesty documented for another report about Uyghur parents abroad trying to reunite with their children still in Xinjiang, [[[Amnesty International, Hearts and Lives Broken: The Nightmare of Uyghur Families Separated by Repression, 19 March 2021, www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/03/the-nightmare-of-uyghur-families-separated-by-repression/.]]] CNN tracked down and visited one of these children who expressed a desire to reunite with her family, [[[Footnote to CNN]]] only for Chinese state media to pay a visit to the child and her grandparents, who shortly afterward appeared in a video refuting any wish to reunite abroad. [[[Footnoe to Chinese video?]]]</p>
<p>Reporting about the situation from abroad also carries significant risks. In several instances, when journalists who reported on or spoke about the situation in Xinjiang from abroad, have seen their family members back in Xinjiang arrested, sent to a camp or prison, or disappeared. [[[Add in examples from RFA and others, and from our campaign “cases”]]]</p>
<p>Chinese government officials have also made a concerted effort to disseminate inaccurate and deliberately misleading information, both to foreign nationals and to the local population, about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Internment camp survivors told Amnesty International that they were forced to give false statements to their families or to the media, both while interned and after they had been released. [[[SURVIVORS BEING FORCED TO GIVE FALSE STATEMENTS: 27, 35 + ADD]]] Survivors told Amnesty that while they were detained they had been coached about what to say to foreign journalists or Chinese government delegations that visited their camps. [[[SURVIVORS BEING COACHED: 13, 26, 51 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 13] told Amnesty how he was trained to speak with journalists who were expected to come to the camp he was in:</p>
<p><strong>“One day they told us journalists were coming. And that when you see them to smile. And to say what you were told or you will be taken to an underground room [where people are tortured]</strong> <strong>… [During the days before the journalists were scheduled to arrive] our Chinese language classes stopped. And we practised answering questions for journalists for more than 10 days</strong> <strong>… we practised saying that the food is good and the Chinese Communist Party is great. I don’t know if the journalists ever came because we were not allowed to go out. I heard they came, but I didn’t see them.”</strong> [[[13]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 36], who spent more than a year in multiple internment camps, told Amnesty she was part of a group that was coached for 20 days about what to say to visiting journalists. “[We were coached] to say that we are studying well, deepening our knowledge, and we are thankful to the state, are getting a salary, that our family is taken care of, that we are here for the daytime only, and here voluntarily,” she said. [[[36]]] None of this was true.</p>
<p>In 2019, leaked Chinese government documents were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), <em>The New York Times</em>, and other media outlets and scholars (see text box X). These leaks appear to have triggered attempts to put even tighter controls on information coming out of Xinjiang, including through the physical destruction of documents related to the internment camp system. Amnesty International received several accounts of Chinese government cadres being made to burn files related to the internment camp system in the aftermath of the leaks. [[[9, 43, 72]]] One camp survivor – a former government cadre – told Amnesty that he participated in burning files. “I attended the burning. It was in … 2019, after I was released … I was helping to carry the files … It was not only the [detainees’] files. It is any re-education–related materials. For example, all notes from meetings … it took five or six days to burn everything [in the office],” he said. [[[4]]]</p>
<p>The authorities’ attempts to silence the affected population and destroy the evidence echo a directive from one of the leaked government documents – known as the “Telegram” – obtained by the ICIJ, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining “strict secrecy” with respect to everything that happens inside camps. [[[https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/ ; https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/china-cables-leak-no-escapes-reality-china-uighur-prison-camp; https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html]]] While the leaked portion of the directive lacks significant details about how secrecy will be maintained beyond the statement that “[i]t is necessary to strengthen the [internment camps’] staff’s awareness of staying secret, and strictly enforce [the Party’s] political discipline and secrecy discipline,” the experiences of survivors and witnesses documented in this report and elsewhere illustrate the immense resources that have been devoted to this cover-up effort, as well as the often harsh and repressive methods used to ensure the silence of the population.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<h2 id="background-on-xinjiang">1.1 Background on Xinjiang </h2>
<p>The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (hereafter referred to as Xinjiang) is in the far northwest of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). At 1.66&nbsp;million km,<sup>2</sup> it encompasses approximately one-sixth of China’s landmass and is bordered by eight countries: Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The area comprises vast semi-desert steppes in the north and desert basins ringed by historic oasis towns in the south. In the winter, temperatures can be extremely cold, far below freezing.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. According to China’s 2010 census, the region had a population of approximately 22 million. More than half of that population belongs to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million), Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hui, and other populations whose languages, cultures, and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han, who are the majority ethnic group in “interior” China.</p>
<p>The area covered by Xinjiang was renowned over centuries for the ancient Silk Road and its flourishing conduit of trade and culture between China and the rest of the world. Rich in coal, natural gas, and oil, Xinjiang is intertwined with many of China’s economic, strategic, and foreign policy goals. China’s leaders now consider stability in Xinjiang vital to the success of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, a massive global infrastructure development programme aimed at strengthening China’s links to Central Asia and beyond. [[[https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/21/china-belt-and-road-projects-should-respect-rights#;]]]</p>
<p>Xinjiang is one of five autonomous regions of the PRC, where officially recognized “national minorities” are granted some formal representation in the organs of regional government. The autonomy conferred to these regions by the PRC Constitution and the Law on Regional Autonomy has, however, remained largely symbolic. In Xinjiang, as in the rest of the PRC, all major policy decisions are taken by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p>The government of China considers Xinjiang to have been an inseparable part of China for millennia. But this history is disputed by many, including professional historians. It is also disputed by many Uyghurs, who often perceive China as a colonizing force and aspire to independence. [[[See James A. Millward, “Eurasian Crossroad: A History of Xinjiang,” Columbia University Press, New York, 2007.]]] During the 1930s and 1940s, two independent Republics of Eastern Turkestan were formed successively in Kashgar (1933) and Ili (1944) as attempts to resist Chinese rule. [[[See Linda Benson, “The Ili Rebellion: The Moslem Challenge to Chinese Authority in XUAR, 1944-1949", M.E. Sharpe, New York, 1990; and Dru C. Gladney, “Internal colonialism and the Uyghur nationality: Chinese nationalism and its subaltern subject”, in CEMOTI (Cahiers d’Etudes sur la Mediterranee Orientale et le monde Turco-Iranien), No.25, janvier-juin 1998, pp.47-61.]]] Both republics were short-lived, but they have continued to inspire nationalist opposition since 1949, particularly among some Uyghurs. Inter-ethnic resentment has led to isolated acts of violence targeting state officials, security forces and occasionally the public.</p>
<p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. In 1949, Turkic peoples, the majority of whom were Uyghur, accounted for at least 93% of the region’s population, while ethnic Chinese in the region amounted to about 6–7% of the population. According to official statistics, Han Chinese now make up approximately 40% of the population. With the massive influx of Han Chinese, other ethnic groups have felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land. [[[See Lillian Craig Harris, “XUAR, Central Asia and the Implications for China’s Policy in the Islamic World”, in The China Quarterly, No.133, March 1993, pp.111-129, and Nicholas Becquelin, “Trouble on the Marches”, in China Perspectives No.10, March/April 1997, pp.19-28.]]]</p>
<p>During the first three decades of the PRC, resettlement of Han Chinese into Xinjiang was facilitated by what is now called the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (commonly known as the Bingtuan), an institution established in the early 1950s. The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize Xinjiang, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of Xinjiang, separating the north, where most of the Kazakhs in Xinjiang live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land, and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from Xinjiang regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons. [[[See “New Ghosts Old Ghosts – Prisons and Labor Reform Camps in China” by James D. Seymour and Richard Anderson, M.E. Sharpe, 1998, p.45. Chapter 3 of the book includes detailed information about the Bingtuan and its network of labour camps and prisons, as well as the separate penal establishments under the Department of Justice of Xinjiang regional government. 7 During the 1990s, the Bingtuan has been placed directly under the authority of the central government in Beijing and has been granted privileges giving it the same status as Xinjiang regional government (see South China Morning Post, 17 April 1997, and Ming Pao, 28 August 1998).]]]</p>
<h2 id="cycles-of-discrimination-violence-and-repression-from-the-1980s-to-2016">1.2 Cycles of discrimination, violence, and repression from the 1980s to 2016</h2>
<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim groups living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and repression by their government, including with respect to their human rights to freedom of movement and freedom of religion, their right to take part in cultural life, as well as their rights to access employment, education, and health care. This historical discrimination lessened under the “Reform and Opening” policy launched in the late 1970s and the subsequent economic reforms, which catalyzed a revival of Islamic religious practices in Xinjiang as with other religions in the rest of the PRC in the 1980s. The authorities allowed the reopening of mosques, many Muslims were again allowed to travel to Islamic countries and contact with Muslims abroad was encouraged. [[[See Lillian Craig Harris, op.cit., p. 121, and Gaye Christoflersen, “XUAR and the Great Islamic Circle: The Impact of Transnational Forces on Chinese Regional Planning”, The China Quarterly, No.133, March 1993, pp.130-151.]]]</p>
<p>Chinese authorities’ fears of organized political opposition in Xinjiang appear to have been heightened by the emergence of independent Central Asian states with the breakup of the Soviet Union after 1989, protracted conflicts in other neighbouring countries, fears that Islam might provide a rallying point for ethnic nationalism and concerns that Islamist movements abroad might inspire young Uyghurs who had gone to study in foreign Islamic schools. This concern led to a reversal of the relatively liberal policies implemented during the 1980s, which combined other factors has generated growing ethnic discontent in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The continuing influx of Han Chinese internal migrants, discrimination, unequal economic opportunities, curbs on religious and cultural rights, and enforcement of the government’s birth control policy are among the factors fuelling unrest. Abuses by government offices and discontent over government policies along with increasing interethnic tensions have led to cycles of sporadic violence and heavy-handed repression.</p>
<p>The government’s fears were reinforced by incidents of violence during the mid-1990s. [[[See https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/144000/asa170181999en.pdf]]] At that time, the authorities closed many mosques and Qur’anic schools, imposed tight controls on the Islamic clergy, and dismissed or arrested religious leaders deemed to be too independent or “subversive”. Muslims working in government offices and other official institutions were prohibited from practising their religion under threat of losing their jobs. In 1996, the government intensified its campaign against “national separatists”, “religious extremists”, and “illegal religious activities”, launching at the same time an “in-depth atheist education” campaign to purge grassroots Communist Party committees and other institutions of Muslim believers.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States of America and the start of the “Global War on Terror”, restrictions on Muslims increased as China began to classify Uyghur dissidents as terrorists and to pressure the rest of the world to designate Uyghur separatist groups as terrorist organizations.

<p>Policies of repression intensified further in the aftermath of several incidents of violence between 2009 and 2013, including violent unrest in Urumqi that erupted on 5 July 2009. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/36000/asa170272010en.pdf]]] According to official counts, rioting left nearly 200 dead and at least 1,700 injured, with most of the casualties reported to be Han. [[[https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/XUAR-reassessing-the-recent-violence/]]] Many hundreds of Uyghurs were detained as police made house-to-house sweeps following the riots, and harsh punishments were imposed on those alleged to be responsible for the violence, following trials that Amnesty International considers to have fallen short of international fair trial standards. The courts handed down numerous death sentences and heavy prison terms. [[[Uyghur Human Rights Project, Can Anyone Hear Us?: Voices from the 2009 Unrrest in Urumchi, 1 July 2010.]]] Dozens of other detainees were reported to have been victims of enforced disappearances, being held by authorities without any notification to family members or lawyers.

<p>In addition to repressive criminal-justice measures, other measures that fall under the broad category of “social management” were designed to prevent instability in the first place. These included an increase in the number of police in Xinjiang: 8,000 officers were hired with the goal of establishing a police presence in more rural parts of the region.

<p>In 2015, China passed a new anti-terror law that further enabled violations of ethnic minorities’ rights to freedom of religion and expression by giving legal justification for persecuting people who peacefully practise religion or criticize the government. [[[See: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/03/china-draconian-anti-terror-law/]]] The law also required technology firms to help the authorities to decrypt information.

<p>In line with an overall shift to the use of big-data analysis and “predictive policing”, China began looking to technology to identify people “likely” to become “terrorists”. [[[Roberts 202]]] The intrusive nature of the data gathered to support the predictive policing campaign was justified by the government’s anti-terrorism law. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/03/china-draconian-anti-terror-law/]]] It gave the authorities access to communication, travel and work history; social media profiles; internet search history; financial information; and family connections. [[[Roberts]]] The data was aggregated and entered into the government’s Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), a big data collection program that analyzed the information gathered by government cadres and electronic surveillance systems throughout Xinjiang and determined whether a person was “normal” or “untrustworthy”.

Since arriving in Xinjiang, Chen’s strategy has involved heavy investment in security infrastructure.

<p>Between November 2019 and January 2021, journalists, scholars and human rights groups published a half-dozen caches of leaked Chinese government documents related to the situation in Xinjiang. Together, they form the most comprehensive source of documentary evidence about the government’s actions and intentions with respect to the system of persecution and mass internment in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>In November 2019, <em>The New York Times</em> reported that it had obtained more than 400 pages of internal Chinese government documents. According to the <em>Times</em>, the documents, known as the Xinjiang Papers, “confirm the coercive nature of the crackdown in the words and orders of the very officials who conceived and orchestrated it”. The documents included information about senior government officials ordering mass detentions, including speeches by President Xi Jinping in which he calls for an all-out “struggle against terrorism, infiltration, and separatism” using the “organs of dictatorship” and showing “absolutely no mercy”. The documents also showed that government officials who were insufficiently supportive of the campaign were purged, and that the internment camp system expanded greatly after the appointment of Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who has been quoted as saying “round up everyone who should be rounded up.” [[[The Xinjiang Papers: Austin Ramzy and Chris Buckley, “’Absolutely No Mercy’: Leaked Files Expose How China Organized Mass Detentions of Muslims: More than 400 pages of internal Chinese documents expose an unprecedented inside look at the crackdown on ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region.” The New York Times, 16 November 2019, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html]]]</p>

Known as the China Cables, these documents included what has been described as a “operations manual” for running the internment camps in Xinjiang. This manual – known as the Telegram – includes instructions for camp officials about “how to maintain total secrecy about the camps’ existence”, “methods of forced indoctrination”, and the “points” system used to evaluate detainees. The cache also includes four intelligence briefings – known as “bulletins” – that reveal information about the government’s mass data gathering and surveillance program, including the Integrated Joint Operation Platform, and how information the IJOP gathered was used to “select entire categories of Xinjiang residents for detention.” [[[The China Cables: Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian “Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorithm.: A new leak of highly classified Chinese government documents reveals the operations manual for running the mass detention camps in Xinjiang and exposed the mechanism of the region’s system of mass surveillance.” International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/.]]]</p>

<h2 id="violations-of-human-rights-outside-of-internment-camps-since-2017">2.1. Violations of human rights outside of internment camps since 2017</h2>
<p>In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying campaign against “terrorism”, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses of Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. An objective of the government’s current campaign appears to be to “root out” Islamic religious practices and beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and behaviours, and, ultimately, to forcibly assimilate the ethnic populations of Xinjiang into a homogenous Chinese nation possessing a unified language, culture and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party.and President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>To achieve this political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation, the government commenced a campaign of mass detention. The internment camp system is part of a larger campaign of subjugation and forced assimilation of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The government has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour outside the camps. These policies violate multiple human rights, including the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion and belief; to participate in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination.. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life for millions of members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology, coupled with its ability to make large portions of the region’s population help it to execute its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minority groups is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a non-independent legal system act in concert to conduct the surveillance and enforce rights-violating policies. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been detained, live in constant fear of arrest, detention, and torture under a draconian system of social control that is a constant affront to basic human dignity.</p>

<p>Freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief is a human right enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, among other international human rights instruments. [[[UDHC, ICCPR, Racial discrimination Add a sentence that ICCPR is ony signed not ratified, but CERD and ICESCR are binding? (Here or elsewhere?)]]] These documents not only require that the human rights described in them be respected and ensured without any distinction, such as on the base of religion, but also that the law must prohibit and protect against any such discrimination. [[[ICCPR A2, 26; ICESCR A2.2; International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination A1;]]] They also “impose a duty upon States to be impartial guarantors of the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief, including the right to freedom from religion, for all individuals and groups within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction… States are also obliged to ensure that individuals belonging to minorities are able to practise their religions or beliefs”. [[[Report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, A/HRC/37/49 paras 28-29]]]</p>
<p>Article 18 of the ICCPR sets out the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion as comprising two elements: the right to hold convictions or beliefs, and the right to manifest one’s religion or beliefs in worship, observance, practice, and teaching. No limitations whatsoever are permitted on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to <em>have or adopt</em> a religion or belief of one’s choice. Restrictions on the freedom to <em>manifest</em> religion or belief are permitted, but only if limitations are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. The UN Human Rights Committee, the body of independent experts established under the ICCPR to monitor states’ compliance with their obligations under that treaty, has stressed that this last principle must be strictly interpreted, and, in particular, that “restrictions are not allowed on grounds not specified there, even if they would be allowed as restrictions to other rights protected in the Covenant, such as national security”. [[[UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 22: The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Art. 18), UN Doc.

<p>Article 27 of the ICCPR protects the rights of ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities, in community with others, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion and to use their own language. The UN Human Rights Committee has stated that this right includes elements that must be respected in all circumstances, and cannot be made subject to derogations. [[[8 HRC General Comment 29, §13(c);]]] The CERD, which is binding on China, requires states to “ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms” in the cultural field, among others. [[[CERD Articles 2(2)]]]</p>
<p>Many aspects of human life, including religion, are affected by culture – the context of individuals’ lives in their communities. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which China ratified, requires its states parties to ensure everybody’s enjoyment of all cultural rights, including the right to take part in cultural life. [[[ICESCR Articles 3, Article 15(1)(a); UDHR Article 27(1)]]]&nbsp;Related rights, such as the right to adequate food and to education, require that food and education policies be culturally appropriate. While the ICESCR requires states to take steps to progressively achieve the full realization of the right to take part in cultural life, there is a “core” obligation “to create and promote an environment within which a person individually, or in association with others, or within a community or group, can participate in the culture of their choice”. [[[Committee on Economic. Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) General Comment No. 21: Right of everyone to take part in cultural life, UN doc. E/C.12/GC/21, 21 December 2009, para 55]]]</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has explained that the term “to take part” includes the components of participation in, and access and contribution to, cultural life.

E/C.12/GC/21, 21 December 2009, para 15]]] Accessibility is a necessary condition for the full realization of this right, and includes “the right of everyone to seek, receive and share information on all manifestations of culture in the language of the person’s choice, and the access of communities to means of expressions and dissemination”. [[[Committee on Economic. Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) General Comment No. 21: Right of everyone to take part in cultural life, UN doc. E/C.12/GC/21, 21 December 2009, para 16]]] If any measure limits the right to take part in cultural life, the state has to prove it is justified in taking that measure, including that the measure is in pursuit of a legitimate aim, is strictly necessary, and is in compliance with other human rights laws and standards.

<p>According to China’s constitution and other laws, citizens “enjoy freedom of religious belief” and the state protects “normal religious activities.” [[[China’s constitution article 36, national security law 27; The government, however, has not explicitly defined which practices qualify as “normal”.]]] Muslims in Xinjiang, however, have faced severe restriction on their religious freedom for decades (see Chapter X). In 2017, these restrictions became significantly more severe. [[[See --- insert examples of articles.]]] In March 2017, highly discriminatory “Regulations on De-extremification” were adopted that further restricted certain Islamic religious practices, both in law and in effect. [[[See XUAR Uyghur autonomous region regulations on de-extremification; https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/china-XUAR-families-of-up-to-one-million-detained-demand-answers/]]] Open or even private displays of religious or cultural affiliation, including growing an “abnormal” beard, wearing a veil or headscarf, regular prayer, fasting, avoidance of alcohol, or possessing books or articles about Islam or Uyghur culture could be considered “extremist” under the regulations. In the aftermath of the creation of these regulations, many religious figures, intellectuals, and academics were detained in Xinjiang merely for exercising their rights to freedom of religion and expression. [[[This includes Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur economist, writer and professor who was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 and Tashpolat Teyip, former president of XUAR University who was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve in 2017, both on charges of “separatism”; Amnesty International, China: Uyghur academic faces execution in China: Tashpolat Teyip (ASA 17/1006/2019)]]] In conjunction with these regulations, government brochures describing “75 signs” of religious extremism were widely distributed. The alleged signs of religious extremism included: wearing beards or face coverings; interference with family-planning policies; building religious venues without approval; participating in unapproved pilgrimages; making minors fast, pray or study scripture; ceasing to drink or smoke or to participate in regular social activities; buying or storing large amounts of food; and buying too much gasoline, camping gear or strength-training equipment without proper reasons. Citizens were instructed to report “extremist” activities to local authorities. [[[See XUAR Uyghur autonomous region regulations on de-extremification, https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/898563.shtml; https://archive.fo/XLxqi]]]</p>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed 6X Muslim men and women who lived in Xinjiang between 2017 and early 2020. They described an environment that was extraordinarily hostile to the practice of Islam. By the time these individuals left China, none felt comfortable displaying any signs of religious practice and all believed that doing so would result in them being detained and sent to a camp. According to these witnesses, numerous Islamic practices that Muslims widely consider essential parts of their religion that were not explicitly prohibited by law in Xinjiang are now, in effect, prohibited. Muslims are prevented people from praying; attending mosques; teaching religion; wearing religious clothing; and giving children Islamic-sounding names. [[[Interviews discussing restrictions on religion: 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 25, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 54, 65, 66, 68; 69, 70, 72 + ADD]]] Former residents also said that appearing insufficiently secular – for example, not drinking alcohol, not smoking, or eating only halal foods ­– was also grounds for being classified as suspicious and sent to an internment camp. [[[11]]]</p>
<p>As a result of the constant credible threat of detention, Muslims in Xinjiang modified their behaviour to such an extent that they no longer display outward signs of religious practice. [Pseudonym 72] told Amnesty that Muslims in his town changed their behaviour in order to dissociate themselves from the practice of Islam. “Before [2017] we could pray, and we could fast … In 2016, the governor of Xinjiang was greeting Muslims during Ramadan. But after the camps started, people did not pray or fast … People were afraid even to talk to imams … We could not even greet each other in the Islamic way,” he said. [[[72]]] Many other former residents also reported that they have either been instructed by the authorities or that it was generally understood that it was forbidden to use traditional Islamic greetings. “We couldn’t say ‘<em>as-salamu alaykum</em>’ to each other anymore,” [Pseudonym 70] said. [[[70, 68 (check)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 65], who had been involved with his local mosque for most of his life before being taken to an internment camp, told Amnesty he found that people in his village had stopped praying after his release: “Not a single person [in my village] can pray anymore. It is because the government is against religion. They are against Muslims.” [[[65]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 12], who had been sent to a camp for his affiliation with what he described as a government-approved mosque, told Amnesty how people’s behaviour in his village had changed as a result of the new restrictions put in place in 2017 and still in effect when he was released from the camp in 2019:</p>
<p><strong>“Now [in 2019] people have stopped talking about religion</strong> <strong>… No one comes to Friday prayers [in our village] anymore</strong> <strong>… Every village has its own policies. In our village women were eventually allowed to wear headscarves again</strong> <strong>… in other villages they cannot</strong> <strong>… I’ve heard that in some villages you could read the Qur’an, but in our village it is completely forbidden, even today.”</strong> [[[12]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 11] told Amnesty that civil servants had been prohibited from fasting and attending mosques for several years, but that in 2016, the government started to try to prevent everyone from fasting and praying. “They forbade us from fasting, especially during Ramadan. They would call us to [the village administration office] and feed us. And during Ramadan they would monitor whose light was on in the house [to see who was praying]… People started to be afraid of [being seen] not drinking alcohol,” she said. [[[11]]]</p>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed witnesses who said the government prevented them from carrying out traditional rituals and ceremonies for marriages, baby-naming and funerals. [[[RITUALS: 62, 78, 69, 70, 72 +ADD]]] “Now if someone dies only direct relatives come to funerals,” [Pseudonym P1] said. [[[12]]] [Pseudonym 70] told Amnesty: “In the past we used to pray and celebrate religious holidays. Now, none of this happens… No one can pray at funerals anymore. It makes people really upset because they cannot bury their loved ones in the proper way.”</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 72], a camp survivor, told Amnesty that, since 2017, government cadres had asked people in his village to sign documents stating whether they were religious and that many people who were religious felt compelled to say that they were not religious because they were afraid of what might happen to them if they told the truth. [Pseudonym 72] further described how police and government cadres halted a funeral he attended in 2019 in the middle of the ceremony because they said that the dead person had signed a document saying that he was not religious and that it was therefore not permitted to perform religious funeral rituals for him. [[[72]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 19], a Uyghur woman and camp survivor, recounted how government officials had stripped the religious aspects from traditional ceremonies in her village:</p>
<p><strong>“Weddings are now held according to the instructions of government. In our tradition, the imam reads verses [from the Qur’an] and gives names to new-born babies, but now it is [a government official] who give names and there is no reciting the Qur’an… And there are forbidden names [to give to your children], the Islamic names… They also started to change the names of people who already had Islamic names, like ‘Mohammed’.”</strong> [[[19]]]</p>
<p>Witnesses further told Amnesty that the government openly pressured ethnic minorities – particularly Uyghurs – to marry people from the Han Chinese ethnic group. Others stated that some members of ethnic minorities were marrying Han Chinese because they believed it would stop the problems they have with the government. [[[9]]] “The government encourages people to intermarry and gives privileges [to those who do], like exempting you from re-education and also some economic benefits … People intermarrying with Han get the same rights as Han … All of this is on television. It is in newspapers. They promote it,” [Pseudonym 19] told Amnesty. [[[19]]]</p>
<p>Journalists and academics have reported that the government has enacted policies to incentivize members of ethnic minority groups to marry Han Chinese. The policies reportedly include cash payments, free education for children, tuition subsidies, greater consideration for government housing and jobs, and extra points on college entrance exams for children of interethnic couples.

<p>Witnesses also told Amnesty that schools had stopped providing instruction in Uyghur and Kazakh and were required to teach only in Chinese. [[[STOPPED INSTURCTION IN UYGHUR?KZAKH: 69 + ADD; See also: https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/language-07282017143037.html]]]</p>
<h3 id="destruction-of-religious-and-cultural-artifacts">Destruction of religious and cultural artifacts </h3>
<p>Numerous former residents of Xinjiang told Amnesty that it had become forbidden to possess any religious artifacts in their houses or any religious content on their phones, including religious books, films, or photographs. Amnesty international also spoke with three individuals – two former government cadres and one person who assisted government cadres – who had been involved with the monitoring and searching of people’s property, including two who provided first-hand accounts of removing prohibited artifacts from Muslim households.</p>
<p>Several former residents also said that cultural books, artefacts, and other content associated with Turkic Muslim culture have, in effect, been banned. Members of ethnic minority groups were pressured to destroy these and replace them with Chinese books and art. [[[ISLAMIC ARTEFACTS: 4, 12, 19, 25, 44, 45 (cultural?) , 12, 66, 72 + ADD]]] “The restrictions are not just about religious things … I was in my cousin’s house and [they were made to take down] their traditional wood carvings, and even the carpets [were cut]. There was something written in Uyghur on the back of the carpet… Since it was written in Uyghur [the authorities] made them cut it off,” [Pseudonym 72] said. [[[72]]]</p>
<p>Former residents reported that their houses were searched by police or government cadres. Some reported burning or destroying all of their books and cultural artefacts related to Islam or Uyghur or Kazakh culture in anticipation of being searched. “There was an announcement that everyone should bring in their books [to the government office]… We had a bookshelf. We had Uyghur books. We didn’t submit the books because that would be supplying evidence. So, we hid the books. Some people burned the books. We hid them while I was there,” [Pseudonym 25] said. [[[25]]] “We were afraid. We tore [our Qur’an] into little pieces and then burned it,” [Pseudonym 72] said. [[[72]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 11] described how she observed that between 2016 and 2017 government officials in her area went from targeting certain “categories” of religious people – for example, those who dressed in a religious manner or other local government officials (who were required to be secular) – to targeting all Muslims. She said that in 2017 local government officials started searching all Muslims and Muslim households for signs of religious practice. She described the lengths her family went to hide the religious artefacts in their house:</p>
<p>“<strong>[Security agents] started checking phones in the street and searching for Qur’ans and prayer mats and prayer beads [in our house]… We had to get rid of these things… We couldn’t just throw [our Qur’ans] away so we put them in a pot and boiled it, then we threw it away. We believed that if we boiled it then the police couldn’t find the fingerprints on the books.”</strong> [[[11]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 19], who worked for the government, said government officials would regularly visit the houses of Muslim families in her village to check for any signs of religious practice, and that if religious artefacts were found, those families were at risk of being sent to camps. [[[19]]]</p>
<p><strong>“[I]f there is a crescent on the door, you have to remove it. If there is any shape, like a dove or an ark, you have to change it… Anything from a different culture, you have to change it. … There was one Qur’an given by the government allowed in each house. You can’t have anything else related to religion.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 69], a government cadre, told Amnesty how government cadres and police barged into the houses of Muslim families and forcibly confiscated all religious artefacts:</p>
<p><strong>“We went to [a part of the village] where 20 families from [a Muslim ethnic minority group] live. We had to take out everything to do with religion and show them that these were illegal things… While we were doing this, we wouldn’t even knock on the door… We would just go in without asking for permission… People were crying… We gave everything to the police… We also told them to remove things written in Arabic.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 69] also explained to Amnesty that government cadres regularly monitored the houses of ethnic minorities for religious artefacts. “[When we visited the houses of families we were responsible for] we had to make sure they did not have a photo of a mosque or anything linked to religion. And everyone was required to have a Chinese flag. We told them to remove photos [of mosques] and to put up flags.” [[[69]]]</p>

[[[https://www.aspi.org.au/news/cultural-destruction-and-detention-facilities-XUAR]]] Pilgrimage sites have particular importance in Uyghur religion and culture.

<p>Amnesty interviewed numerous people who said that mosques in their towns and villages had been destroyed or repurposed. [[[MOSQUES DESTROYED: 54, 42, 44, 47, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72 +ADD]]] Many camp survivors reported witnessing dramatic changes in their villages when they returned home, including the destruction or repurposing of mosques and other cultural artefacts. [Pseudonym 44] told Amnesty what it was like when he saw his village for the first time after being released from the camp. “They removed crescents from every mosque… and from the furniture in homes… Now every house had to have a picture of [President] Xi Jinping. Before we had a picture of a mosque,” he said. [[[44]]] [Pseudonym 42] told Amnesty many of the mosques in his area were destroyed and restaurants were no longer allowed to display halal signs. “It’s like they are trying to erase Islam,” he said. [[[42]]] [Pseudonym 21] told Amnesty his township used to have 15 mosques, including two in his village, but now 13 had been repurposed:</p>
<p><strong>“Only two mosques are operating now. Thirteen closed down… Only a very small number of people still pray [at the remaining mosques]. They are all very old… I couldn’t even pray at home. They were monitoring me. I was afraid... Some [of the closed] mosques are empty, some are clothing factories… but all minarets are demolished and Islamic decorations removed… Both mosques in my village [including the one still operating] had minarets demolished.”</strong> [[[X21]]]</p>
<p>Witnesses also mentioned that Islamic crescents and Arabic script had been removed from the remaining mosques as well as from other cultural and religious sites, including gravesites. “Some mosques were demolished … others had crescents taken off and Chinese flags put up in their place … Crescents were also taken off gravesites. For example, my mother died, and my brother had to take the crescent off the gravestone. Officials in the village made him do it,” [Pseudonym 68] said. [[[68]]]</p>
<p>Government demolition of religious venues has not been limited to mosques in Xinjiang. Under Xi Jinping, the government has intensified efforts to “sinicize” religions, including Islam and Christianity, that are considered “foreign”. Since 2014, particularly in coastal Zhejiang Province, thousands of crosses have been torn down from churches and other churches demolished and under the pretext of regulating excessive and illegal religious sites.

<p>Muslims living in Xinjiang may be the most closely surveilled population in the world.

<p>Amnesty International interviewed 64 members of ethnic minority groups who lived in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2020, each of whom provided accounts of what it was like to experience certain aspects of the government’s system of surveillance. Amnesty also interviewed one Han Chinese person who visited Xinjiang and described his observations of the surveillance state. [[[60; for another account of a Han Chinese man in XUAR see https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/06/witness-to-discrimination-confessions-of-a-han-chinese-from-XUAR/]]] According to these witnesses, the system of surveillance involves extensive, invasive in-person and electronic monitoring in the form of:</p>

<h3 id="the-right-to-privacy-under-international-law-and-mass-surveillance-as-a-human-rights-violation">The right to privacy under international law and mass surveillance as a human rights violation</h3>
<p>The right to privacy is a human right protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR, among other instruments. [[[The right to private life is enshrined in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (CCPR) to which China is a signatory.]]] According to ICCPR Article 17(1): “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence[.]” Any interference with the right to privacy must always be legitimate, necessary and proportionate, and everyone has the right to the equal protection of the law against interference that is not.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate mass surveillance is the widespread bulk monitoring, interception, collection, storage, analysis, or other use of communications material that is not targeted at an individual or an identifiable and distinguishable group or location, and that is not based on reasonable suspicion. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/03/easy-guide-to-mass-surveillance/]]] Surveillance violates the right to privacy unless it is strictly necessary and proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate aim. Amnesty International believes that indiscriminate mass surveillance is never a proportionate interference with the human rights to privacy and freedom of expression. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/amnesty-international-calls-for-ban-on-the-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-for-mass-surveillance/]]]</p>
<p>Any communications surveillance must be authorized in accordance with domestic laws that are publicly accessible and foreseeable in order to be lawful. The law must be clear enough to give people an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances under which the authorities are empowered to resort to communications surveillance. Effective safeguards against abuse must be set forth in law and include the nature, scope, and duration of the possible surveillance measures; the grounds required for ordering them; the authorities competent to permit, carry out, and supervise them; and the remedy process provided.</p>
<p>Facial recognition technology (FRT) for identification, that is, its use to establish who an individual might be (in contrast to the verification, or “authentication”, of the facial image of a person presenting themselves against the facial image registered for that specific person to verify if they are the person they claim to be) is a form of indiscriminate mass surveillance, and, as such, is a violation of the right to privacy and other human rights. [[[Face identification systems are used to identify individuals by their face, among a number of people, by comparing that face against a database of images to see if any matches are found. This kind of system is used by law enforcement to identify individuals against a watchlist. The individual is typically not involved in this process, which in particular does not require prior credentials to have been registered by them. In contrast, face verification systems (also described as face authentication systems) scan a face and attempt to match this face to a corresponding face image on a database of existing images. They are used, for example, to enter a building or pass through border control at an airport. The individual is typically involved in this process, including when a facial image is recorded at the time of registration.]]] FRT that scans and captures data from all faces within its radius is neither necessary nor proportionate in any circumstance. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/amnesty-international-calls-for-ban-on-the-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-for-mass-surveillance/]]]</p>
<p>FRT significantly hampers the rights to peaceful assembly and to freedom of expression. States are increasingly turning to FRT to monitor public spaces at large. Not only is this an interference with the rights of peaceful assembly, freedom of association and freedom of expression, it can create a chilling effect and seriously deter peaceful dissent and the participation in public life.</p>
<p>FRT can have a disproportionate impact on marginalized groups, undermining the right to equality and non-discrimination. The technology can and is being used by states to intentionally target certain individuals or groups of people based on their protected characteristics, including ethnicity, race and gender. Even if this is not the stated aim of the technology, discriminatory impacts nevertheless present a huge risk. This technology can exacerbate and entrench existing societal disadvantages and further disempower already-marginalized groups of people.</p>

<p>[Pseudonym 69], who worked for the government, told Amnesty that local government officials classified household into three categories: “targeted” (usually those that had family members in the camps), “trusted” (normally government officials) and “ordinary” (everyone else). “Targeted” households were subjected to heightened in-person monitoring and electronic surveillance.

<p><strong>“I had to gather information on [several dozen families in my area]… We had to gather information on many things, on their relatives abroad, about whether they had given their children Islamic names… I don’t know how all the information was used… [We didn’t gather all the information at once]… We would get an order… for example, to go and get a passport… In 2016 we had to gather everyone’s passports… Or to find out if anyone [from the household] had been travelling to Kazakhstan… Or who prays… [In 2016 and 2017] we just asked them about praying… They didn’t know how it would be used at the beginning.”</strong> [[[69]]]</p>
<p>One of the most invasive aspects of in-person surveillance in Xinjiang for members of ethnic minority groups is the practice of government “homestays”. Since 2014, the government has assigned cadres to live in the homes of ethnic minority residents. The programme was expanded in 2017 and has reportedly included more than one million cadres who spend a few days a month living in ethnic minority households. Referred to as “relatives”, the predominantly Han Chinese cadres are tasked with monitoring and reporting any suspicious behaviour – such as religious practice or political views – and with carrying out political indoctrination. [[[https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/13/china-visiting-officials-occupy-homes-muslim-region; https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/26/china-nightmare-homestay-XUAR-uighur-monitor; https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/14/asia/china-XUAR-home-stays-intl]]] According to the government, the programme is said to “promote communication and interaction among different ethnic groups in Xinjiang”.</p>
<p>According to [Pseudonym 69], all “targeted” households were required to have a government cadre stay overnight in their house three times a week. Numerous camp survivors interviewed by Amnesty said that government cadres were required to stay with them in their houses for several nights per week or per month after they were released from a camp. [[[GOVERNMENT MINDERS: 7, 8, 9, 72, 30, 9, 5, 6, 19, 27, 25, 15, 36, 61, 65, 66, 28 +ADD]]] Survivors also reported that, while they were in the camp, their family members were required to have minders stay with them. [[[GOVERNMNET MINDERS WITH FAMILY: 9, 11, 12, 27, 68 +ADD]]] Some camp survivors reported that cadres checked in on them during the day but did not stay overnight. [[[cite]]]</p>
<p>The cadres took pictures of them and their family, monitored their behaviour, and tried to teach them “correct” ideology. [[[27]]] Minders also checked homework from the language and ideology classes members of ethnic minorities are forced to attend (see Chapter X). [[[28]]] [Pseudonym X12] told Amnesty that after she was released from a camp, minders would come and inspect her house every day to make sure she was home, and they would check her homework from the night school. “If you passed the homework test they leave, or they would stay and help you do the homework,” she said. [[[X12]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym X13] told Amnesty International that when her father was sent to a camp, she and her mother were forced to move back to their home village and have a government minder stay with them. She described what the minder did while staying with the family:</p>
<p><strong>“She ate with us. Listened to what we were saying. Told us about politics. About our</strong> <strong>crimes. For example, [she said:] ‘Do not go abroad. Do not contact the outside world. Be thankful for the government. Confess that your father committed crimes.’… She stayed overnight ... She stayed in the same room as me … She took photos of us. And she told us to attend classes.”</strong> [[[9]]]</p>
<p>Similar cadre homestays have been widely reported by journalists and other human rights organizations. [[[One major feature of the ongoing Strike Hard Campaign is the deployment of “fanghuiju” (䇯ᜐ㚊)15 teams in XUAR. Between 2014 and 2017, XUAR authorities sent 200,000 cadres from government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and public institutions to be stationed in villages, regularly visit and surveil people, and subject them to political propaganda, a scheme that has been extended indefinitely.16 In October 2016, authorities initiated a related effort, called the “Becoming Family” (㔃ሩ䇔Ӣ) campaign. Since December 2017, this “Becoming Family” campaign has been expanded as a compulsory homestay programme where more than a million cadres spend at least five days every two months in the homes of XUAR residents primarily in the countryside.17 16 “200,000 Communist Party members Dispatched to Stay in Grassroots Villages in XUAR to Visit the People, Benefit the People, and Get Together the Hearts of the People (ᯠ⮶ 20 зᵪޣᒢ䜘лสቲտзᶁˈ䇯≁ᛵǃᜐ≁⭏ǃ㚊≁ᗳ),” People Online (Ӫ≁㖁, http://xj.people.com.cn/GB/188750/361873/ (accessed August 14, 2018). 17 “China: Visiting Officials Occupy Homes in Muslim Region,” Human Rights Watch news release, May 13, 2018, https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/13/china-visiting-officials-occupy-homes-muslim-region.]]] Journalists and investigators have also reported incidents of sexual violence occurring within the context of the programme.

<p>According to numerous camp survivors Amnesty has interviewed, having unsanctioned software installed on their phone – including VPNs and encrypted messaging platforms such as WhatsApp – was grounds for being detained and sent to an internment camp (see Chapter&nbsp;X). Journalists have reported that not having a smartphone can also be viewed as suspicious, as can throwing out a SIM card, having a SIM but not using it, or activating multiple SIMs in a year. [[[https://docs.uhrp.org/pdf/MassDetention_of_Uyghurs.pdf]]]</p>
<p>Survivors told Amnesty that government officials informed them not to visit some websites, especially those related to Islam or certain aspects of Turkic Muslim culture. “We were forbidden from visiting certain websites… And on your phone you can’t write anything about the Qur’an or Allah, and certain words are forbidden. You can’t write anything about Kazakh heroes,” [Pseudonym 5] said. [[[5]]]</p>
<p>Government agents regularly search the contents of phones owned by Muslims (see below).

<h3 id="freedom-of-movement-under-international-law">Freedom of movement under international law</h3>
<p>Freedom of movement is a human right enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. [[[Article 3(1) of the UDHR; Article 12(1) of the ICCPR]]] According to the UN Human Rights Committee, “Liberty of movement is an indispensable condition for the free development of a person.”  [[[]]] Freedom of movement encompasses the ideas that, in principle, everybody has the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose a residence within a state’s territory, but is also free to leave any country, including their own. [[[Freedom of movement also guarantees the the right to enter one’s own country, of which one may not be arbitrarily deprived (see Article 12(4) of the ICCPR).]]]</p>
<p>International law permits states to limit these aspects of the right to freedom of movement only in limited circumstances, if based on clear legal grounds, necessary and proportionate to protect certain specified legitimate aims, and consistent with other human rights. [[[See also the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation of Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, UN Doc.

<p>Muslims living in Xinjiang cannot move freely. The government restricts their travel both within Xinjiang and between Xinjiang and the rest of china. [[[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/in-chinas-far-west-experts-fear-a-ticking-timebomb-religious; https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/09/09/eradicating-ideological-viruses/chinas-campaign-repression-against-XUARs; https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/china0918_web2.pdf]]] Certain movement restrictions appear to affect all Muslims; more severe movement restrictions are placed on camp survivors, the families of camp survivors, and other targeted people.</p>
<p>For several months after being released, nearly all camp survivors were essentially placed under some form of house arrest or “neighbourhood” arrest. Those who were occasionally allowed to leave their house or the other areas that they were confined to, were required to get written permission from the authorities beforehand. After this period, some of the restrictions placed on their freedom of movement are slowly lifted. (For more on freedom of movement restrictions placed on camp survivors see Chapter&nbsp;X).</p>
<p>Members of ethnic minority groups who have never been sent to internment camps also face serious restriction on their movements within Xinjiang. Former residents of Xinjiang reported they and their family members were forbidden from travelling outside their neighbourhood without permission. [[[FAMILY MEMBER FORBIDDEN TO TRAVEL&nbsp;: 5 12, 13, 39, 19, 62, 70 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 62], a Uyghur woman who had been studying outside of Xinjiang, returned to her hometown in 2018 to find that she now needed written permission from local government officials to travel to see her friends in another town. She told Amnesty the movement restrictions also affected her family and her community. “People were not moving anywhere [outside of our neighbourhood] because they could not get permission… My [family members] couldn’t go anywhere. They were essentially bonded to the house and to their work,” she said. [[[62]]]</p>
<p>Interviewees said there were specific Uyghur neighbourhoods in cities where permission was needed to enter. [[[PERMISSION TO ENTER SPECIFC NEIGHBOURHOODS: 45 + ADD]]] “Since 2016, there were special areas in Ürümqi where Uyghur communities are totally blocked. If I want to go into these areas then I have to give the police my ID and tell them where I am going and for how long,” [Pseudonym 45] said. [[[45]]] [Pseudonym 19] told Amnesty the Uyghur population in her town had their movements restricted; her movements were even further restricted because she had travelled abroad:</p>
<p><strong>“There is a travel restriction. If we need to go from town to town we need to get permission [from the government]… Guests need to be registered and you need to ‘guarantee’ that guest… Because I went abroad, I had a ‘[alert]’ on my ID… When I went [to this town] there was a checkpoint and they checked my ID card and told me to come into a room where they held suspicious people… [After that] I was afraid to use my ID.”</strong> [[[19]]]</p>
<p>Former residents reported that a “flag” was assigned to their ID for reasons they did not know and they were prevented from travelling to certain areas or entering certain buildings as a result. “If you got [flagged] from a checkpoint then the [flag] would stay with you… [I got flagged] and I was prevented from riding a bus and from entering a hospital.” [[[25]]]</p>
<p>These movement restrictions are enforced through ubiquitous network of electronic surveillance. Whenever members of ethnic minorities do move about in Xinjiang, the government tracks their movements through their phones and by the ever-present network of surveillance cameras on street corners and lamp posts, many of which have facial recognition capabilities. [[[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-XUAR.html; https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html]]]</p>
<p>Journalists have reported that the facial recognition technology is specifically programmed to “detect, track, and monitor Uyghurs.” [[[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/china-testing-facial-recognition-surveillance-system-in-XUAR-report; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech-uighurs/chinese-tech-patents-tools-that-can-detect-track-uighurs-idUSKBN29I300]]] “Every roof of a police station, a checkpoint, also has many cameras. On every corner, on every red light, there are many cameras. You can’t count. There are so many… They are at the entrance of every Uyghur-populated area,” [Pseudonym 45] said. [[[45]]] [Pseudonym 13] told Amnesty a camera was installed outside his house after he was released from a camp. [[[7]]] [Pseudonym 70] said officials threatened to install a camera in his place of work after they interrogated him and accused him of behaving suspiciously. [[[70]]] Two individuals who worked for the government told Amnesty that officials installed cameras outside the houses of families that were being monitored. [[[9, 69]]] “Targeted families have cameras installed outside of the gates of the house [to monitor them]… I saw this everywhere,” [Pseudonym 69] said. [[[69]]]</p>
<p>In addition to surveillance by ubiquitous cameras, the population is monitored by a huge number of security forces, who often check IDs and search people’s phones in the street, and by thousands of “convenience police stations” and other checkpoints located throughout Xinjiang.

They are everywhere. In one street you might be checked several times. You might be questioned several times,” [Pseudonym 14] said. [[[14]]] “[In 2016 and early 2017] the police were everywhere, you could hear the ringing of police sirens all the time,” [Pseudonym 46] said. [[[46]]] “Assistant police started randomly checking everyone’s phones… They were taking anyone with something [forbidden] on their phone to the camp… I used to clean my phone before I went into the city… It was a very scary time,” [Pseudonym 70] said. [[[70]]]</p>
<p>Numerous residents told Amnesty how large numbers of security checkpoints were constructed in their towns and neighbourhoods in 2017. [[[21]]] “After Chen [Quanguo] came he built thousands of police outposts in the street. Every 200–300m. I saw them myself every day in Ürümqi. … My home is on [a street], and in a very short time five to six [convenience] police stations were built within 1–2 miles [on the street],” [Pseudonym 52] told Amnesty International. [[[45]]] [Pseudonym 02] told how the security forces grew dramatically in his area after 2017 and what it was like to go through checkpoints:</p>
<p><strong>“In streets, the police outnumbered people… Every street had a temporary police station… it was impossible to get into the market without an ID. They would check ID, search your body and then let you in… In the temporary police stations… you go through a metal detector and facial recognition, and scan your ID card. If there are no problems you can go through, if not, the room is divided into two parts. It is divided by glass with police on other side. If something is wrong, you are questioned [on the other side].”</strong> [[[4]]]</p>
<p>Residents told Amnesty that at checkpoints, they were required to have their IDs scanned, to have iris or facial scans, and to have their phones and sometimes their bodies searched. [[[CHECKPOINTS: 4, 14, 12, 21, 11,8, 21, 54, 43 (check) + ADD]]] Interviewees also said they were required to scan their ID when they made purchases in butcher shops or gas stations, and that anything suspicious that was purchased, like a knife, needed to have a QR code on it. [[[SHOPS: 6,7, 10, 25, 31 + ADD]]] “I went to the town centre for shopping. I went to a tailor… The [tailor’s] scissors had a bar code on them and were chained to the wall… Police were checking stores all the time. Even irons were chained to the wall,” [Pseudonym 62] said. [[[62]]] “In 2017… at every shopping centre, even little boutiques had to register the customers who came in and out so the police could follow up,” [Pseudonym 43] said. [[[43]]]</p>
<p>Former residents of Xinjiang said movement restrictions are enforced in a discriminatory manner. Interviewees said the police only stopped ethnic minorities on the street and checked their IDs. [[[DISCRIMINATION: 2,4,5,7,8,21, 31, 10 +ADD]]] Witnesses, including one who worked at a government checkpoint, reported that Han Chinese either did not need to go through the checkpoints at all or were essentially waved through without having to have their bodies or phones searched and without being questioned. [[[31, 72 + ADD]]] “Only Uyghurs have to go through checkpoints,” [Pseudonym 4] said. [[[4]]] “There is an extra step for people from Xinjiang to get through airport security. They scanned our body twice with an x-ray machine,” [Pseudonym 21] said. “After the Ürümqi riots, until 2016, only Uyghurs had to go through checkpoints. In 2016/2017 they started to check Kazakhs as well. I was on a bus and thought I did not have to [get off and go through the checkpoint] but the auxiliary police checked my ID and found out I was Kazakh and I had to get off the bus. Hans don’t have to go through that,” [Pseudonym 5] said. [[[5]]] [Pseudonym 72] also reported that members of ethnic minorities were regularly asked to get off public buses to be searched, but not Han Chinese. [[[72]]] “At malls and hospitals [everyone has to swipe their IDs]… but in the street only Muslims have to do this, Han people didn’t have to swipe. And if a Han person forgets their card they can still be let in,” [Pseudonym 66] said. [[[66]]]</p>
<p>Several witnesses reported that at train stations and airports there were separate lines for Han Chinese and ethnic minorities. [[[60 , 72 + ADD]]] “In 2019, I went to Ürümqi. … before [I got on the train] I had to go through a very strict checkpoint, and when I got off the train they directed Han Chinese in one direction and Muslims in another… [Muslims] had to go through checkpoint again.” [[[72]]] [Pseudonym 77], a Han Chinese man who visited Xinjiang, told Amnesty about the discrimination he witnessed while travelling:  [[[2]]]</p>
<p><strong>“The surveillance cameras are literally everywhere… The discrimination is so blatant. When I board a train they didn’t check anything, but the Uyghurs sitting right across from me, they check their tickets and their phones… When I was in the station there were two lines [for security checks], one for Uyghurs and one for Han without facial recognition, just through a metal detector. The line for Uyghurs was very long... Under a tunnel in [a major city] I just walked by, but Uyghurs had to have a full body check with metal detectors, including old men. They were checked at both sides of the tunnel. I was carrying luggage and no one even checked my bag. I went through the [security] door, but no one checked with a wand… Because I am Han, I was not checked… I spoke with a [government official] who said, ‘Uyghurs have to be treated differently because there are no Han terrorists’.”</strong> [[[60]]]</p>
<p>Members of ethnic minorities told Amnesty they had difficulties booking hotel rooms and renting apartments when they travelled outside their hometowns. [[[DIFFICULTIES BOOKING HOTELS&nbsp;: 5, 62, 21, 70 +ADD]]] “In Beijing, the hotel we booked online refused to check us in… They said it was because our documents were from Xinjiang… I think they rejected us because they were afraid the police would come… I felt like a third-class citizen,” [Pseudonym 21] said. [[[21]]] “We were always rejected by hotels. Every time, people from the front desk would tell us that they can’t accept us, or that they don’t have a room… Sometimes we would be deregistered if we had booked online. And if they did accept us, the police would always come [to the room],” [Pseudonym 63], a Uyghur woman, said. [[[63]]]</p>
<h3 id="restrictions-on-leaving-or-entering-china">Restrictions on leaving or entering China</h3>
<p>The government makes it extraordinarily difficult – often impossible – for members of ethnic minority groups, particularly Uyghurs, to travel abroad (see Chapter&nbsp;X). All members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang were forced to hand over their passports to the government in 2016 and 2017. [[[https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/22/china-passports-arbitrarily-recalled-XUAR; https://docs.uhrp.org/pdf/Weaponized_Passports.pdf; 4, 26, 42]]] Very few people have been able to get them back. The vast majority of known cases of people getting their passports back have been ethnic Kazakhs with ties to Kazakhstan. These cases of passport returns are reportedly a result of pressure placed on China by the government of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Very few cases are known of Uyghurs or members of other non-Kazakh ethnic groups being able to leave Xinjiang since 2017, and nearly all known cases involve people with strong family ties to foreign countries or individuals who paid large bribes and have exceptionally strong contacts with senior government officials. [[[UYGHURS GETTING OUT&nbsp;: 70 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 70], an ethnic Kazakh who was able to go to Kazakhstan after paying a “broker” to get his passport back, told Amnesty that a Uyghur friend of his tried to do the same thing with the same broker and was told it was impossible because he was Uyghur. [[[70]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 21], who left Xinjiang to study before 2017, told Amnesty that while he was living in China he had to hand over his passport to local officials. When he tried to get it back so he could go abroad he was told he was not allowed to have his passport because he was member of a minority. “My family had to pay a bribe to get my passport,” he said. [[[21]]] [Pseudonym 45], a Uyghur man who left Xinjiang in early 2017, told Amnesty he believes he was one of the last Uyghur people to be able to leave:</p>
<p><strong>“In February 2017, our community [administration office] took back our passports and told us they were just copying them and we would get them back… I doubted I would get mine back but I got mine back [and then I left the country]. I heard in May 2017 that everyone’s passport was taken again. And they were never returned. After I left, very few [Uyghurs] were able to leave. I am one of the last who left.”</strong> [[[45]]]</p>
<p>Moreover, according to survivors Amnesty has interviewed, as well as reports from journalists and leaked government documents, travelling abroad, attempting to travel abroad, or associating with people abroad is grounds for being detained and sent to an internment camp (see Chapter&nbsp;x).</p>

<p>Amnesty International interviewed 52 people – XX men and XX women – who had been sent to internment camps and later released. All of these camp survivors had been arbitrarily detained for what appears to be, by all reasonable standards, entirely lawful conduct; that is, without having committed any internationally recognized criminal offence. These internment camp detentions violated numerous fundamental aspects of international human rights law. All of the detainees were denied due process during and after their initial detention. None were allowed access to legal counsel. None were provided with an arrest warrant or even a reason for their detention that included a credible allegation of a criminal offense recognized under international law.</p>

Since <em>The New York Times</em> investigation, the government has not released any more data on incarceration rates.</p>
<p>According to another report by Human Rights Watch, also relying on government statistics, in 2017 there was a dramatic increase in the number of lengthy sentences handed down by courts in Xinjiang. Before 2017, prison sentences longer than five years accounted for approximately 11% of the total number of people sentenced. In 2017, 87% of sentences were more than five years.

<p>Unlike the process of detention for people who are sent to internment camps, there appears to be a formal legal process attached to prison sentences. This process, however, is deficient. According to an analysis of the prison of the prison sentences carried out in Xinjiang in 2018, authorities only made about ten percent of criminal verdicts public, which is dramatically lower than in the rest of the country.

Human Rights Watch’s analysis of sixty of the public verdicts, “suggests that many people have been convicted and imprisoned without committing a genuine offense.” [[[Human Rights Watch, China: Baseless Imprisonments Surge in Xinjiang – Harsh, Unjust Sentences for Uyghurs, Other Muslims, 24 February 2021, www.hrw.org/news/2021/02/24/china-baseless-imprisonments-surge-xinjiang#]]]</p>

<h3 id="the-initial-detention">The initial detention</h3>
<p>Internment camp survivors Amnesty International interviewed were often detained without warning. Many were detained from their houses in the middle of the night. [[[FROM HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT: 17, 28 +ADD]]] Many were called by the police or by their village administration office and told to report to a police station – often under the pretence of being requested to hand in their passport – and then detained once they arrived. [[[CALLED TO POLICE STATION: 37, 48 +ADD]]] Several were pressured by government officials or employers to come back from working, studying, or living abroad and then detained shortly after returning, often at the airport or land border. [[[COERCED BACK FROM ABROAD: 28, 10, 35, 32 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 70], a government cadre who participated in mass arrests in her county, told Amnesty how, in late 2017, police took people from their homes without warning, how family members of the detained people reacted, and what the role of government cadres was in the process:</p>
<p><strong>“I was there. … The police would take people out of their houses… with hands handcuffed behind them, including woman… and they put black hoods on them. … The police had a list [of people to detain]. … Nobody could resist. Imagine if all of a sudden, a group [of police] enters [your home], cuffs you and puts [a black hood] over your head. … [Family members of the people being detained] just asked why this was happening. … We accompanied [the police]. [Cadres] did not do much [related to physically detaining people]. Our main duty was to calm down and comfort the relatives [of the people who were detained] and tell them these things happened all the time. … It was very sad. … [After I did this and I returned to my house] I cried. … That night we made 60 arrests. … That was just in one district [they were making arrests in all the districts]. … Every day they arrested more people.”</strong> [[[69]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 19], who also worked for the government during the time that large numbers of detentions were made also told Amnesty that many people were arrested. “In many families it was just women left. In some houses the door is locked because both parents are gone and the children are taken to boarding school,” she said. </p>

<h3 id="arbitrary-detention-in-international-law">Arbitrary detention in international law</h3>
<p>Under international human rights law, everyone has the right to liberty of person. [[[Article 3 of the Universal Declaration, Article 9(1) of the ICCPR]]] Arrest or detention is permissible only for reasons, and according to procedures, that are established by law. [[[Article 9(1) of the ICCPR, Article 17(2)(a) of the Convention on Enforced Disappearance; An arrest is “the act of depriving a person of liberty under governmental authority for the purpose of taking that person into detention and charging the person with a criminal offence”. It covers the period from the moment the person is placed under restraint up to the time the individual is brought before a competent authority that orders release or continued custody; The term detention is used to describe when a person has been deprived of his or her liberty by a state authority (or with the state’s consent or acquiescence) for any reason other than being convicted of an offence. The person may be held in a public or private setting that they are not free to leave, including a police station, a pre-trial detention facility or under house arrest.]]] Domestic law authorizing arrest and detention and setting out the grounds and procedures for arrest and detention must conform to international standards. [[[Amnesty International, Fair Trail Manual, 2014, https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/8000/pol300022014en.pdf;]]] Any deprivation of liberty outside the context of criminal charges cannot amount to an evasion of the limits on the criminal justice system by providing the equivalent of criminal punishment without the applicable protections. [[[HRC General Comment 35, §14]]]</p>
<p>According to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, arbitrary detention includes situations when an individual is deprived of their liberty without a clear basis in law; where persons are detained solely for the peaceful exercise of certain rights such as the rights to freedom of movement and residence, as well as of thought, conscience and religion (Articles 13 and 18 of the UDHR); in cases of total non-observance or otherwise sufficiently serious violations of the right to fair trial; and when the deprivation of liberty constitutes a violation of international law for reasons of discrimination, such as on the basis of ethnic origin, language, religion or opinion. [[[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Deliberation No. 9 concerning the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law, UN doc. A/HRC/22/44, 24 December 2012, para. 38]]]</p>
<p>Arrest or detention that is arbitrary, or already unlawful under domestic law, is always prohibited under international law and standards. [[[Article 9 of the Universal Declaration, Article 9(1) of the ICCPR; the Human Rights Committee has clarified that the term “arbitrary” in Article 9(1) of the ICCPR must be interpreted broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice, lack of predictability, and due process of law, as well as elements of reasonableness, necessity and proportionality; HRC General Comment 35, §12]]] Examples of arbitrary detention further include prolonged detentions without charge or trial and secret, prolonged incommunicado or indefinite detentions without review. Keeping a person in any form of detention without being subject to periodic re-evaluation of the justification for continuing the detention. [[[HRC General Comment 35, §§11, 12]]] The UN Human Rights Committee has called the detention of family members of an alleged criminal who are not themselves accused of any wrongdoing “egregious examples of arbitrary detention”, and enforced disappearances “a particularly aggravated form of arbitrary detention.” [[[HRC General Comment 35, §§16, 17]]] Conditions of detention inappropriate for its purpose can also make detention arbitrary, and denial of access to counsel and family may result in violations of the right to liberty. [[[HRC General Comment 35, §59]]]</p>
<p>Arbitrary detention facilitates torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances, and other abuses. An important means of preventing these abuses is to ensure that proper grounds and procedures for deprivation of liberty are adhered to at all times, in compliance with international standards.</p>
<p>Policies and procedures allowing arrest and detention based on racial, ethnic, or other profiling should be prohibited. [[[https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/GC31Rev_En.pdf]]] Anti-terrorism laws targeting one ethnic group are discriminatory and never permitted. The prohibition of arbitrary detention is also a norm of customary international law and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has stated that the prohibition constitutes a peremptory norm of international law; this means it cannot be the subject of treaty reservations or derogations but must be respected at all times, including in times of war or other public emergency. [[[Report to the Human Rights Council, Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, UN Doc. A/HRC/22/44 (2012), paras 37-76.; see also 4 HRC General Comment 24, §8, HRC General Comment 29, §11]]]</p>
<p>When anyone is arrested or detained, they must be notified of the reasons for their arrest or detention and of their rights, including their right to legal counsel. [[[Article 9(2) of the ICCPR,]]] They must be informed promptly of any charges against them. [[[Article 9(2) of the ICCPR, Article 14(3)]]] This information is essential to allow persons to challenge the lawfulness of their arrest or detention.</p>
<p>International standards require that anyone arrested or detained be informed of their rights and be provided with an explanation of how they may avail themselves of such rights. These standards variously require notification of rights, including the right to notify a third person, obtain legal counsel, receive medical assistance, challenge the lawfulness of detention, not incriminate oneself, including having the right to remain silent, and complain and have recourse for complaints about ill-treatment or conditions.

<h3 id="reasons-for-detention">‘Reasons’ for detention</h3>
<p>Some former detainees interviewed were provided with a reason for their detention at the time they were initially detained; however, many were not given a reason until after they were sent to an internment camp, and often not until shortly before they were released, when they were forced to “confess” to “crimes”. [[[NOT PROVIDED WITH REASON AT START: 39 + ADD]]] Several were given different reasons for their detention when they were detained than they were when they were released. [[[GIVEN DIFFERENT REASONS: 32, 3 + ADD H]]] Some were never given a reason. [[[NEVER GIVEN A RESONS: 18 (check) + old people + ADD]]] “Until today, I don’t know why I was in the camp,” [Pseudonym 37] said. [[[37]]]</p>
<p>Individuals Amnesty International interviewed said the reasons they were given for their detention were often not tied to specific acts; rather, detainees were informed that they had been detained because they had been classified as “suspicious” or “untrustworthy” or as a “terrorist” or an “extremist.” [[[SUSPICIOUS/EXTREMIST: (guard), 42, 33, 7, 10, 14, 40 + ADD]]] The precise criteria for such classifications are not known; however, the government of China has used these terms – particularly terrorist and extremist – in over-broad ways in the context of counterterrorism legislation. [[[Amnesty International, China: Draconian anti-terror law an assault on human rights, 4 March 2015, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/03/china-draconian-anti-terror-law/.]]]</p>
<p>When specific acts were mentioned, they generally fell into a few broad categories. One category includes offenses related to foreign countries. Numerous survivors were detained for living, travelling, or studying abroad or for communicating with people abroad. [[[ANYTHING ABROAD: 1,2, 6, 10, 13,15, 17, 27, 32, 33, 37, 5, 26, 19, 18, 21, 7, 72, 36, 41, 50, 66, 40 + ADD]]] Many were detained for being “connected” with people who lived, travelled, studied, or communicated with people abroad. [[[CONNECTED WITH PEOPLE ABROAD: 30 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>Another category of detainee includes those arrested for offenses related to using unauthorized software or digital communications technology. Many survivors were arrested for using or having forbidden software applications on their mobile phones, especially WhatsApp. [[[FORBIDDEN TECHNOLOGY: 32, 27, 6, 41, Y2, 17, 68, 6, 17, 27, 41, 50, 66, + ADD]]]</p>
<p>Another common category includes anything related to religion. Survivors were arrested for reasons related to Islamic beliefs or practice, including working in a mosque, praying, having a prayer mat, or possessing a picture or a video with a religious theme. [[[RELATED TO RELIGION: 47, 12, 43, 24 (father), 42 (check); 44; 14 (beheading video – this should maybe go somewhere else) +ADD]]]</p>
<p>Other survivors were detained for having too many children or otherwise violating China’s family planning policies. [[[5 (secondhand account)]]] One survivor said they had been detained for refusing to work for the government. [[[19]]] [Pseudonym D2], who while detained helped dozens of other inmates fill in “confession” forms on which they were required to list their “crimes”, said the most common reason she observed was “having multiple household registrations”, which is prohibited under Chinese law. [[[40; insert footnote about what a household registration is …]]] (For more on self-confession forms, see Chapter X below.) One survivor, who was accused of this offence just before her release, told Amnesty she had no idea that having multiple registrations was illegal or that she was still registered at her family’s home where she grew up. She believed that the government was just using this as a pretext to detain whomever they wanted. [[[HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION: 7, 66 + 69]]]</p>
<p>A few survivors told Amnesty they had been detained after receiving explicit permission to do the very thing they were reportedly arrested for. [Pseudonym B3] told Amnesty he was detained for travelling domestically, even though he had obtained prior approval to do so from the appropriate authorities. [[[B3]]] [Pseudonym C1] told Amnesty he was detained twice for travelling – once abroad and once domestically – even though he had gotten permission from the appropriate authorities to do so both times.</p>
<p><strong>“[After I was detained the second time] I asked the village chief [why I was arrested]. He said, ‘We are doing what we are told. We don’t know why. All people who are travelling abroad go to the camp. You have no right to ask questions.</strong> <strong>If you ask why it will be seen as resistance. It will not be good for you. You will get answers in the camp.’”</strong> [[[C1 (and check b3)]]]</p>
<p>The reasons for detention that camp survivors provided to Amnesty International are consistent with testimonial and documentary evidence that journalists and other human rights investigators have gathered. [[[Foreign Policy, 48 Ways to Get Sent to a Chinese Concentration Camp: Something terrible is happening in Xinjiang, 13 September 2018, https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/13/48-ways-to-get-sent-to-a-chinese-concentration-camp/.]]] Most significantly, these stated reasons are broadly consistent with the official reasons that individuals were detained and interned contained in the the Karakax list [[[Adrian Zenz – Journal of Political Risk (https://www.jpolrisk.com/karakax/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=1bf107f177c74e6a374534a5b67f318bd3c20654-1593419000-0-AarOWg7fOY15RU81T9S4iyxxdRuWk_gcXH3o3btoqCg12v3VFqb4dsrbQakV_ifhZbEBMSoBxSdiESh1_vWLp_4swN7WQYjrY53t29JrQcYBK2v0UHgy8Fzo8FkYvXmvSTnwZfKOEcoG--U27mBxY4DS73KHW6aW-NisulkwRGWLBlE6ZRzIrOz-08BGdJrdFtYbj8doa6FZq1DT8c-Ls2V6En8CqQhzKz2YjOWzhz3hFwlS7hhxCnAG9_CrPFoqz5VfIBpaKYCfv14nc0a2P7qTkbdOvqIYz8KuASXqWD7q)]]] and the Aksu list [[[HRW -- https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/09/china-big-data-program-targets-XUARs-muslims]]]</p>
<p>The Aksu list includes government records on over 2,000 people who were detained and interned after being flagged by the IJOP. The list reveals that “suspicious” behaviour often leading to arrest and detention included regular religious practice, such as reciting the Qur’an or wearing religious clothing; having more children than permitted by China’s policies; using certain computer software, such as Skype or a virtual private network; travelling abroad, or travelling domestically without permission; having “extremist thoughts”; being untrustworthy; or being young. [[[https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/09/china-big-data-program-targets-XUARs-muslims]]]</p>
<p>The Karakax list includes government records on over 3000 people, provides the official reasons for why 311 were detained and interned, and some of the reasoning behind why certain detainees are released or not released from the camps. The document also reveals significant information about how the government collected detailed information on the family members and social networks of detainees. [[[Ivan Watson and Ben Westcott, “Watched, judged, detained: Leaked Chinese government records reveal detailed surveillance reports on Uyghurs families and Beijing’s justification for mass detentions. https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/; https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/asia/xinjiang-china-documents-icij-intl-hnk/index.html; https://www.vice.com/en/article/epgadw/leak-secret-documents-show-how-china-targets-muslims-for-re-education-camps-and-spies-on-their-families; https://www.jpolrisk.com/karakax/; https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/02/20/more-evidence-chinas-horrific-abuses-xinjiang; https://apnews.com/article/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c]]] A scholarly analysis of reasons revealed that they fall broadly into eight non-mutually exclusive categories, including untrustworthiness, anything religion-related, and anything linked to locations abroad. The most common reason for detention was violating China’s birth control policies.</p>
<p>According to another internal document leak – the so-called China Cables – hundreds of thousands of individuals have been arrested for using certain mobile phone applications. The documents also explicitly instruct authorities to arrest Uyghurs who also hold foreign citizenship, and to work towards the repatriation back to China of those living abroad. [[[China Cables: https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/]]]</p>
<p>Xinjiang Victims Database documents the testimonies of internment camps survivors, their families, and other witnesses. [[[https://shahit.biz/eng/#home]]] While the data the project has collected does not necessarily represent the interned population as a whole, analysis of 3,613 testimonies shows that the most commonly stated reasons for detention are related to religion, going abroad, having contact with the outside world, and the behaviour of the internees’ relatives. Additionally, an analysis of the official reasons for which 1,486 individuals were detained indicates that other common reasons include allegations of “separatism”, violating birth policies, and “extremism”, as well as other vague justifications, such being untrustworthy or disturbing public order. [[[https://shahit.biz/eng/#stats]]]</p>
<p>Journalists have reported that government officials were required to fulfil arrest quotas and that people were essentially arrested randomly. [[[For reporting on quotas see: Human Rights Watch, China: Big Data Program Target’s Xinjiang Muslims – Leaked List of Over 2000 Detainees Demonstrates Automated Repression, 9 December 2020, www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/09/china-big-data-program-targets-XUARs-muslims#; Radio Free Asia, Nearly Half of Uyghurs in Xinjiang’s Hotan Targeted For Re-Education Camps, 9 October 2017, www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/camps-10092017164000.html; Radio Free Asia, Xinjiang Authorities Up Detentions in Uyghur Majority Areas of Ghulja City, 19 March 2018, https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/detentions-03192018151252.html.]]]</p>
<h3 id="guilt-by-association">Guilt by association</h3>
<p>Analyzed in concert with the Aksu and Karakax lists and other testimonial and documentary evidence gathered by journalists, the testimonial evidence Amnesty International has gathered demonstrates that members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are often detained on the basis of guilt by association. Many were interned as a result of their relationships, or perceived or alleged relationships, with family, friends, or community members – many, if not most, of whom were themselves not guilty of any internationally recognized criminal offence. [[[The Karakax list contains information on individuals’ behaviours and beliefs in light of their family and social contexts. Some may be considered “guilty by association” based on the number of the family members who are under some form of internment and on the “religious inheritance circle” (宗教传承圈), or how a person obtained religious knowledge in the family. add in quotas: That regions were given quotes of people to arrest - Reoberts argues that this critier can vary buy region, to get ot the quota… given definition so broad, officials have significant leeway…]]] Many survivors were arrested for having a family member who was considered to be suspicious or untrustworthy or who was accused of being an “extremist”, “separatist”, or “terrorist”, or for contacts with others facing these accusations. [[[H1 (guard), D1, Z1, N1, M1, R1 (on phone)]]]</p>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed former residents of Xinjiang who believe that their own behaviour was the reason their family members were arrested. [[[BEHAVIOUR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FAMILY DETAINED (maybe also cite examples from journalists abroad): +ADD]]] [Pseudonym X4] went abroad and did not return on time. He told Amnesty his father was sent to a camp because of his decision. [[[Find]]] [Pseudonym A1], who also did not return from abroad on time, said the police called him from his house in China and had his son ask him to return from abroad and tell him the family would be sent to the camps if he did not. Since then, he has not been able to communicate with his family. “I do not know where my children are,” [Pseudonym A1] said. [[[kyrgyz]]] [Pseudonym 14], a camp survivor, told Amnesty that his father was taken to an internment camp because his father “let” him go abroad after he was released. “When my father was about to be detained, the police call me and said come [back to China]. … They said we will let your father go if you come back.” [[[14]]]</p>
<p>In addition to often being grounds for detention, guilt by association is now a pervasive theme in the life of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It is a tool for the social control that the Chinese authorities impose on the population. As illustrated in a variety of ways throughout this report, the behaviour of members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang affects their family, their community, and the group as a whole. Credible threats against family members are used to control or modify behaviour (see Chapter X and X below).</p>
<h2 id="torture-and-other-ill-treatment-during-interrogations-at-police-stations">3.2 Torture and other ill-treatment during interrogations at police stations </h2>
<p>The majority of survivors Amnesty interviewed were interrogated at police stations before being sent to a camp. [[[interrogated before being sent to camp: 7, Vi (Egypt), K2 (Kazakhstan) +ADD]]] A minority were sent directly to the camps without being interrogated. [[[sent directly to camps without being interrogated: + ADD]]] Most of the interrogations focused on what the person had purportedly been detained for (that is, anything related to foreign countries, to religion, or to having “illegal” photos, videos, or software on their phone). Interrogations usually lasted several hours. A few detainees reported being extorted during the interrogations, saying they were told that if they paid the police they would not be sent to a camp. [[[Insert examples of extortion during interrogations: (maybe add a quote)]]]</p>
<p>The content of the interrogations in police stations was very similar to interrogations survivors went through inside the camps and after their release. Many survivors described being asked the same questions over and over again by different government officials during multiple interrogations over the course of months and even years while in detention. [[[Multiple interrogations: + ADD]]]</p>
<p>Detainees were tortured or otherwise ill-treated during the interrogations in police stations, before being transferred to the camps. [[[Torture and Ill treatment:5 (sleep deprivation), 42, 3 (elderly), 8 (old), 10, 7 (interviewed before), 13, 35 (check), &amp; (tiger), 10(tiger), 18 (tiger), 41 (tiger), 38 (beatings) + ADD]]] Interrogations and torture were often carried out by members of the domestic security police, known as Guobao; some were carried out by local police. Survivors were often interrogated in “tiger chairs” – steel chairs with affixed leg irons and handcuffs that restrain the body, often in painful positions, to an extent that it is essentially unmovable. [[[RESTRAINTS/TIGER CHAIRS IN POLICE STATIONS: 42, 3 (elderly), 8 (old), 10, 7 (interviewed before), 13 +ADD]]] Some detainees were hooded and shackled during interrogations. [[[HOODED AND SHACKLED: 6, 7, 10, 13, 27, 30, 31, 36, 35, 8, 35 (check) + ADD]]] [Pseudonym W1], who spent a year in the camps for visiting Kazakhstan, said he was interrogated for several hours while immobilized in a tiger chair: “I was seated on a metal chair. Hands were cuffed. I was interrogated. My feet were also cuffed… It’s a metal chair that contains a board that your hands are cuffed to. And there is an iron base that you put your legs inside. [The interrogation started late at night,] I was questioned until 3am.” [[[8]]]</p>
<p>Many survivors told Amnesty International that they were held in crowded conditions before being sent to the camps. [Pseudonym F1], who was held in a detention centre for three weeks before being transferred to a camp, told Amnesty he was forced to stand in a small, crowded cell with 50 other inmates all day. “We don’t even put cows in that terrible condition… We slept side by side touching each other,” he said. [[[47 (check if this is a detention center or a police station)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 72] was also held in a detention centre for several weeks before being transferred to a camp. He told Amnesty that his cell very cold and extraordinarily crowded, with nearly 60 men living in a space that he estimated to be 30m2:</p>
<p>“The was a large bed in the cell, people used to sit on the edge of it, but there was not enough space. We let the elderly people sit on the bed. … [The rest of us] had no place to sit or sleep… We slept in turns [because there was not enough space]. The floor was cold and wet. I slept for [weeks] on the floor with no mattress or carpet. … It was [winter] already. Our clothes were very thin. It was very cold. … And it smelled horrible in the cell.”</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 72] also told Amnesty that he could hear female detainees in the cells on the floor above him scream and crying at night. “After they started crying, we started crying too because we were worried about them.”  [[[72]]]</p>
<p>Journalists and other organizations have reported approximately a dozen similar accounts of torture and other ill-treatment, including beatings, overcrowded conditions, and sleep deprivation in police stations and detention centres.

<h2 id="medical-examinations-and-biometric-data-collection">3.3 Medical examinations and biometric data collection </h2>
<p>Before being sent to a camp, nearly all detainees were subjected to a medical examination. [Pseudonym X2], a camp survivor who worked at a hospital where some people were examined before they were sent to the camps, witnessed large numbers of detainees being brought to the hospital, as well as part of the medical examination process.</p>
<p><strong>“In [the city I lived in] there were four hospitals – infection, military, traditional, and regular</strong>. <strong>In 2017 they all started being used for people sent to re-education camps. … At first it was Uyghurs and [Huis].

The whole medical examination was top secret… [The staff at the hospital] had to make sure they were healthy. [The staff] had to draw their blood to make sure they were healthy… They were all young.

She said the tests the hospital did: blood, x-ray lungs, ultrasound for liver and kidney, blood pressure.]]]</p>
<p>All survivors told Amnesty International that in addition to undergoing medical exams they were required to allow government officials to collect their biometric data. [[[BIOMETRIC DATA COLLECTION: 6, 8 + ADD]]] This almost always included multiple photographs, fingerprints, an iris scan, a voice recording, and a writing sample. Biometric data was often collected at police stations. Survivors said blood samples were taken. “Then we went to a police station for what I think was a DNA [sample]… They took our blood, spread it on something, and put it in a plastic wrap,” [Pseudonym 36] told Amnesty when describing her arrest. [[[36]]]</p>
<p>These reports of health checks and biometric data collection are consistent with other survivor accounts reported elsewhere and with reports of widespread campaigns for biometric data collection from all people in Xinjiang, not just those sent to the camps. [[[Human Rights Watch, China: Minority Region Collects DNA from Millions – Private Information Gathered by Police, Under Guise of Public Health Program, https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions; The New York Times, China Uses DNA to Track Its People, With the Help of American Expertise, 21 February 2019, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-XUAR-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html.]]]</p>
<p>After undergoing a medical exam and having their biometric data collected, nearly all detainees were taken to internment camps. Nearly all were handcuffed while being transferred to the camps. Many are hooded and shackled. [[[HOODED AND SHACKLED: 10, 13, 25 (check), 6 (wasn’t herself, witnessed large numbers of others), 41 (witnesses) 27 (check)+ ADD]]] “You can’t see through the hood. You can’t see where you are… I was terrified about where I was being taken,” [Pseudonym 40x] said.” [[[40x]]]</p>
<p>Many were driven to the camps in vans or buses with large numbers of detainees. [[[LARGE NUMBERS TRANSFERRD TOGETHER: 60]]] [Pseudonym 27], who was arrested for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty about being transferred to the camp: “They came in the morning. The police entered our cell [in the police station]. They put a black hood [on me]. Handcuffed me. And dragged me to the bus. And then took us to the camp,” she said. [[[27]]] [Pseudonym 63], an older woman who was arrested for praying, told Amnesty she was taken from a police station in the middle of the night, handcuffed to another woman, put into a truck with about 20 other detainees from her village, and then driven to a camp.

<h2 id="overview-of-detention-conditions">4.1 Overview of detention conditions</h2>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed 50 people – XX men and XX woman – who were detained in internment camps in Xinjiang since 2017. These camp survivors provided a broadly consistent description of life in the camps. The vast majority of them were detained for between nine and 18 months; many were detained in two or more camps.</p>
<p>From the moment they entered a camp, detainees’ lives were extraordinarily regimented; the conditions in the camps were “prison-like”. They were essentially stripped of their personal autonomy; every aspect of their lives was dictated to them. Detainees who deviated from the conduct proscribed by camp authorities – even in the most seemingly innocuous ways – were reprimanded and regularly physically punished, often along with their cellmates.</p>
<p>Detainees had no privacy. They were monitored at all times, including when they ate, slept, and used the toilet. They were forbidden from talking freely with other detainees. When detainees were permitted to speak – to detainees, to guards, or to teachers – they were required to speak in Mandarin, a language many of them, especially older people and those from more rural areas in Xinjiang, did not speak or understand. [[[REQUIRED TO SPEAK CHINESE: 5, 6 +ADD]]] Detainees have been physically punished if they spoke in a language other than Mandarin. [[[PUNISHMENTS FOR NOT SPEAKING CHINESE: 5, 12 +ADD]]]</p>
<p>Detainees were constantly evaluated. According to survivors, as well as to the leaked government document known as the Telegram, detainees were given scores. According to the Telegram, the scores measured the detainees’ “ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline.” A detainee’s behaviour affected his or her score, which factored into the treatment they received in the camp, including “rewards, punishments, and family visits”, as well as when they were released. [[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html.]]]</p>
<p>According to the Telegram, internees were supposed to be able to communicate regularly with their families. [[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html.]]] Some survivors were indeed able to call home every week or every month. [[[REGULAR CALLS: 8, 6 +ADD]]] A few were able to see family members in person a few times during their detention. [[[A FEW TIMES: 8 + ADD]]] Some detainees, though, were never able to call or see their families. [[[NEVER SEE FAMILY: 44 +ADD]]] All calls and interactions were monitored and recorded. [[[6]]] Detainees were coached on what to say to their family members. [[[27]]]</p>
<p>The camps are set up so that it is impossible to practice religion; any sign of religious belief is punished. “We can’t even touch our face, or they would suspect us of praying,” {Pseudonym XX] said. [[[XX]]]</p>

<h3 id="arrival-at-the-camps">Arrival at the camps</h3>
<p>Upon arrival at the camps, detainees were searched, their personal effects were confiscated, and they were made to remove certain items of clothing, including shoelaces, belts, buttons, and anything else that could be used as a weapon or as an implement with which to take their own life, just as is often done in prisons. [[[SEARCHED/CONFISCATED: 40, 48, 26, 47, 13 + ADD]]] Some women internees had their hair cut off after arrivingand some men had their heads and beards shaved.  [[[Female haircuts: 5, 7 + ADD; Heads shaved: 41, 47 +ADD]]]</p>
<p>Shortly after being searched, detainees were taken to their cells. Cells in internment camps are basic rooms, usually holding about eight to 20 people. The cells normally consist of two-level or three-level bunkbeds and small stools or chairs. Most detainees had their own bed, but some shared a bed. A few survivors stated that all people in their cell shared one large bed, known as a <em>kang</em>, which was on the ground, and that people were packed “shoulder to shoulder”. A few survivors stated that when there were more people than beds, some people slept on the floor. There is usually a TV in the cell and often a Chinese flag on the wall. Windows, if they exist, are barred and usually blacked out. There is a loudspeaker in the room through which camp staff speak to detainees. There are several closed-circuit television cameras – usually four – in each cell. Cells often have lists of camp rules and “crimes” hanging on the wall. Most detainees reported that the lights in the cell remain on at all times, including during the night.</p>
<p>Cell doors often have two holes, one for the guards stationed in the hallway to look in and another to pass food through. Cell doors are often positioned so that detainees cannot see any other rooms from their door. The door to the cell is chained to the wall. [[[DOOR CHAINED TO WALL: E2, f2, w1, q1, u1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 17, 41, 54, 72, + ADD]]] [Pseudonym X13] told Amnesty International how humiliating it was to go under the chain every time he needed to leave the cell. “The door is just half open. It was chained to the wall. We had to crawl under the chain one by one, like dogs,” he said. [[[47]]]</p>

<p>Every person deprived of liberty has the right to be treated with humanity and to be held in conditions that are consistent with human dignity. [[[Article 10 of the ICCPR]]] The UN Human Rights Committee has stated that this right is a fundamental and universally applicable rule and a norm of general international law, not subject to derogations but applying at all times, in all circumstances, including in times of emergency. [[[HRC General Comment 21, §4; 8 HRC General Comment 29, §13(a)]]] It has further confirmed that people deprived of their liberty must not “be subjected to any hardship or constraint other than that resulting from the deprivation of liberty; respect for the dignity of such persons must be guaranteed under the same conditions as for that of free persons”. [[[HRC General Comment 21, §3.]]] Furthermore, such people must be held only in a place of detention that is officially recognized and states must ensure that no one is held secretly in prison. [[[Article 17 of the Convention on Enforced Disappearance]]] States are obliged to ensure that detainees have facilities to allow religious practice and communication with others, including those in the outside world.</p>
<p>Conditions in prison must be in line with a state’s human rights obligations, including under the ICESCR, which China has ratified. Everyone, including an individual in custody, has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (Article 12 of the ICESCR). [[[CESCR General Comment 14, §§34, 4, 11, 43 and 44.]]] The right to health extends not only to timely and appropriate health care, but also to underlying determinants of health, such as sufficient, adequate and suitable food, water, and washing and sanitation facilities, [[[See CPT 3rd General Report, CPT/Inf (93) 12, §53.]]] as well as bedding and access to fresh air, natural light, and some form of exercise. [[[See Rules 13-23 of the Mandela Rules, https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/100000/act400012003en.pdf https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/4036/2016/en/]]] The authorities must ensure that all detention facilities are equipped with sufficient and functioning sanitizing equipment and facilities, and access to such facilities and services must ensure privacy and dignity and be socially and culturally acceptable. Cramped and unhygienic accommodation and lack of privacy in custody can amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, as would failure to provide appropriate medical treatment that could reasonably be expected of the state.

<h3 id="classification-of-internees">Classification of internees</h3>
<p>According to government documents and testimony from survivors, detainees were placed into one of three classifications or categories: normal management, strict management, and very strict management. [[[These categories were translated slightly differently during different interviews. I can share the Chinese characters that I asked the translators to write down.K2 – check for Chinese characters; E2 (has Chinese characters), Some people explained the three categories are corresponding to the type of discipline that the detainees in the category were subjected to – ‘school’, ‘military’, and ‘prison’); some shahit accounts indicate classification was later (see: Tabysqan Magrupqan, (Others explained as Normal, strict, and strike hard (19); cite the telegram; Insert somewhere that some claimed dvided after verdicts; this classification system is consistent with leaked documents: International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html.; The China Cables telegram mentions three VTIC management areas: “regular” (普管区), strict (严管区) and “forceful” or “very strict” (强管区); karakax list There appear to be three levels: “common management” (普管区), “strict management” (严管区), and “strong management” (强管区) journalists accounts: BuzzFeed News, What They Saw: Ex-Prisoners Detail The Horrors of China’s Detention Camps, 27 August 2020, https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/china-ex-prisoners-horrors-xinjiang-camps-uighurs]]] Detainees in different classifications were detained in the same camps; however, within camps detainees were placed in cells with other detainees in the same classification. [[[SAW OTHER DETAINEES: 31?, 44?+ ADD]]] Detainees’ uniforms corresponded to their classification. Those in the normal management classification had blue uniforms, those in strict management had yellow uniforms, and those in very strict management had red. [[[UNIFORMCOLOURS: 35 (had this color,said blue in second interview); 5 (has Chinese characters); 16 (said orange, not yellow) + ADD]]] A detainee’s classification could be adjusted in accordance with their “performance and point situation [that is, their score]”. [[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html.]]] According to leaked government documents, being in the normal management group was a necessary condition for being released from the camp (for more on criteria for release see Chapter X).</p>
<p>The exact reasons why specific internees were placed in different categories were not well understood by survivors; however, there was a general belief among survivors interviewed by Amnesty that detainees who were detained for reasons related to religion were more likely to be placed in the two stricter categories. [[[RELIGION + STRICT: 31, 44 +ADD]]] According to survivors, the normal management group was for “ordinary” crimes, such as having prohibited software on your phone; strict management was for “crimes” related to religion; and very strict management was for imams and for people who had previously been convicted of “serious crimes.” [[[EXAMPLESOF PEOPLE WHO ARE INSTRICTER CATEGORIES: 19, 7, 27 (taught in camp) – COMPARE WITH OTHER FOOTNOTE]]] Some survivors believed the classification system was, at least in part, based on a detainee’s ethnicity, because Uyghurs in their camps were much more likely to be placed in one of the stricter categories. [[[UYGHURS MORE LIKELY IN STRICT: + ADD]]]</p>
<p>The type of treatment detainees were subjected to in the camp corresponded to the classifications. Survivors stated that they observed detainees from the different classifications being treated differently. [[[DIFFERENT TREATMENT: 41 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 5], a detainee who also worked in the camp for part of the time she was interned, described some of the differences she observed with respect to the treatment of detainees, especially related to their ability to move around the camp and to communicate with family members.</p>
<p><strong>“Most of the people in the strict management group were there for being religious clerics or somehow involved with religion. … I know this because interrogations [for detainees] sometime took place in the staff room where [I spent time]. … [In the camp I worked in,] the normal management group learned Chinese and were allowed to walk in the yard, the strict [management group] [were allowed to] sit on their beds [some of the time], the very strict learned in their cell, were not allowed to move, and never got fresh air. … The normal group got to make a call once a week and the strict group once every two weeks and visits once a month. … The very strict group was not permitted to have visitors.”</strong> [[[5 (check)]]]</p>
<p>With two exceptions, the survivors Amnesty interviewed were in the normal management category when they arrived in the camp. [[[44 (check); 19 (Uyghur); check 3, 7 (saw), 5 (intervirewed)]]] As a result, nearly all the conclusions in this report – like nearly all the testimonial evidence gathered about the camps from journalists and other organizations – come from evidence provided by survivors who experienced only the normal management treatment. However, given the second-hand accounts about the two stricter categories – which are observations made by survivors and staff who were in the same camps as internees in the stricter categories – it stands to reason that detainees in the stricter categories were treated much more severely and were much less likely to have been released from a camp and instead remain detained or have been transferred to prison (see Chapter X). [[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 44], one of the two survivors Amnesty spoke with who was in the strict category, was given a yellow uniform for part of his stay. His “offense” was related to religion, also suggesting that he was likely in the strict management category during that time. Some of his treatment appears demonstrably worse than that of detainees in the normal management category: He was detained for over two years, was not allowed to call family members when others in his camp not detained for religious crimes were, he was never allowed out of his cell, and his feet were continuously shackled together for several months. “For two years, my family didn’t know if I was alive or dead,” [Pseudonym 44] told Amnesty International. [[[44]]]</p>
<h2 id="daily-routine">4.2 Daily routine</h2>
<p>The life of camp detainees was highly regimented, and in many ways reflects, or is even worse than, life in prisons in China. With the exception of a few survivors describing the portion of their detention that took place in early 2017, every detainee stated that nearly every minute of their lives in the camps was prescribed, including the position in which they sat, when they stood, and where they looked. [[[BETTER IN EARLY 2017: D42 +ADD]]] [Pseudonym 27], who was detained for having WhatsApp on her phone, told Amnesty International how strict the schedule was and how physically draining each day was.</p>
<p><strong>“It was like a prison… [Every day] you got up at 5am and had to make your bed, and it had to be perfect. Then there was a flag</strong>-<strong>raising ceremony and an ‘oath</strong>-<strong>taking’. Then you went to the canteen for breakfast. Then to the classroom. Then lunch. Then to the classroom. Then dinner. Then another class. Then bed. Every night two people had to be ‘on duty’ [monitoring the other cellmates] for two hours. … There was not a minute left for yourself. You were exhausted.”</strong> [[[27]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym], who was detained in early 2017 because he was labelled a terrorist for travelling to Kazakhstan and for having attended a religious school, told Amnesty International the daily regimentation became much stricter in late 2017, to the point where even resting and the direction of your gaze were regulated:</p>
<p><strong>“Before October 2017, it was a little relaxing in class. We could go to the canteen [to eat] by ourselves and we could sit relaxed in class. But after the</strong> <strong>national [security] meeting in October [2017] it became very serious. … We had to be ‘on duty’ at night [monitoring our cellmates]. We were escorted to the canteen. We had no more contact with our family… We must ‘sit tight’. We could not even turn our heads from the TV. … [After it became strict] we got up at 5am. Breakfast was done at 7. Class at 8. We had to [walk] to class through a two-met</strong>r<strong>e-high metal fence with metal ceiling; it was basically a cage. … [we were escorted] to class by two guards with clubs. … There was a bucket in the back of class [to urinate]. You needed permission to go [defecate]. … Rest [after lunch] was mandatory, with heads on desk for two hours. You were punished if you lifted your head.”</strong>  [[[42]]]</p>
<h3 id="sitting-still">Sitting still </h3>
<p>Many survivors reported that before the start of classes, during the first few days, weeks, or sometimes months after arriving at the internment camps, detainees were essentially forced to do nothing but sit still for nearly the entire day. The only breaks were for meals or to sleep. Nearly all survivors were forced to sit or kneel for hours on end. [[[10, 12, 68,]]] “We were given a small stool. We were made to sit in two lines, with straight backs and hands on knees, all day. If one guy [in the cell] moved then the guards outside would bang on the door with a baton and shout,” [Pseudonym 12] said. [[[12]]]</p>
<p>Many survivors reported that this position was very painful for their knees and other parts of their body; some developed haemorrhoids and other health problems. [[[HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM SITTING: 3 (heart), 7 (hemorrhoids), 8(legs), 19, 34, 37, +ADD]]] “We had to sit straight… In our room there were old woman. Their hands and feet swelled up,” [Pseudonym 19 said. Many reported that inmates were physically punished if they were unwilling or unable to sit straight. [[[PUNISHMENTS FOR NOT SITTING STRAIGHT: +ADD]]] Many reported not being permitted to look anywhere but straight ahead. [[[STRIAGHT AHEAD: +ADD]]] [Pseudonym 19] said that she was told that if the people monitoring her cell on the cameras noticed anyone moving their lips, guards would deduct from their “scores”. [[[19]]]</p>
<p>Survivors often had to sing songs or to recite basic Chinese words while they sat still, or in a few instances stood still; others were made to watch Chinese propaganda films. Some literally had to do nothing except sit perfectly still on a small chair or stool in their room. [[[STILL: 37, 34, 13, 16, 17, 28 (“sat on cement for 20 days”); 16 (sat on bed and did nothing for first ten days); 12 (literally did nothing for 3 months), 40 +ADD]]] “I just sat on a stool for three months from morning to 11pm… There was no class, nothing,” [Pseudonym 10] said. [[[17]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym Q1], who was sent to a camp for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty he was in a camp for several months before guards started taking him to class.</p>
<p><strong>“During the days before classes [started] we had to sit on stools [all day]. For 16 hours a day we had to sit on stools with our hands on our knees. We were up at 6am, then sit on stools, then breakfast. … Then sit until lunch. Sometimes we were given a book [to learn from]. We could not talk to other people. We had our lunch sitting on the stool. During lunch we could have a nap of an hour or less, sometimes not at all. … Then we sit again until it gets dark.”</strong> [[[13]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym XM], who was detained for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty that for the first two months after he arrived at the camp, he was forced to sit still in an uncomfortable position for hours each day:</p>
<p><strong>“After breakfast we had to sit on our beds with our hands on our knees and a straight back. If we moved, they spoke to us through a loudspeaker [in the room] and said ‘don’t move’. Then around 11.30/12 they brought lunch. Then from 12.30 to 2 we could lie down [on our bed]. Then at 2pm they told us to maintain the seated position. We sat like that until dinner, but they sometimes said through the loudspeaker that we had five minutes to move, lie down, or to urinate… Around 7pm we had dinner, and then we watched TV [while sitting]. … At 9pm they ordered us to go to bed. … We spent [the first] two months without leaving the room, [except] during the day they took us to the toilet, which was outside the room, to [defecate]. They took us two times a day. … We never went outside.”</strong> [[[XM]]]</p>
<p>The survivor testimony Amnesty has gathered is consistent with survivor accounts gathered by journalists and other organizations. [[[Cite journalists.]]] According to a letter from a former camp guard, inmates were not allowed to show emotion. [[[Erkin azat a letter from a prison guard in the newly built concentration camp in dazanchining, medium 18 may 2019]]]</p>
<p>Based on survivor testimony, it is unclear whether sitting still and doing nothing was a deliberate policy to demoralize or break the will or spirit of newly arrived detainees or if it was a consequence of the fact that at the start of the government campaign of mass incarceration certain camps were not set up to provide any formalized instruction. It is plausible that it was a deliberate policy in certain camps at certain times but not in others.</p>

<p>Detainees were woken, usually at 5 or 6am, every morning by an alarm coming through the loudspeaker or by a loud knock on the cell door. They were required to get up immediately, quickly make their bed, and then brush their teeth and wash their face in a sink. Most cells do not have sinks and detainees had to crawl under the chain attaching the cell door to the wall and then be escorted to a washroom by a guard. [[[CRAWLING UNDER CHAIN: 47, 17 + ADD]]] Detainees were rarely permitted to shower. Some detainees showered once a week; others reported not showering for weeks or even months after they arrived. [[[RARELY ALLOWED TO SHOWER: 13, 10 +ADD]]] A few survivors reported having showers in their cell and that they were monitored on video while showering. [[[SHOWER VIDEO: +ADD]]] “In the new camp, beside the toilet there was a shower and a sink… There was a small partition around the shower, but it is not very tall. If you are standing in the shower they can see you [on camera].” [[[65]]]</p>
<p>Detainees required permission to use the toilet. [[[PERMISSION TO USE TOILET: 12, 35, 8, 26, 72, 3, 5, 13 + ADD]]] Some cells had squat toilets; others had a bucket. [[[BUCKETS: 5(f), 16, +ADD]]] “Even to go urinate in the bucket [inside the cell] we had to get permission from the guard first,” [Pseudonym 13] said. [[[13]]] Detainees were monitored by cameras when using the toilet. [[[TOILET VIDEO: 3 +ADD]]] Guards routinely shouted at internees if they did not go to the bathroom quickly. [[[5]]] “They used to give us one minute to [use the bucket] or they would yell at us,” [Pseudonym 34] said. [[[34 (check)]]]</p>
<p>Survivors were permitted to use the toilet only at certain times. [Pseudonym 53], who spent a year in a camp, told Amnesty he was made to go long period without being able to use a proper toilet:</p>
<p><strong>“At 6am they let us go out one by one to wash and use the toilet… There was a bucket in the cell… Even in the morning there was no guarantee we’ll be let out [to use the toilet]. Sometimes we went 24 hours without being allowed to use the toilet… The bucket was for [urinating]; if you have to [defecate] then you had to use the intercom and they would send two guards… and then you went out under chain. Here you had to squat and put hands on head [when you exited the cell]…</strong> <strong>the process was like in a prison.”</strong> [[[53]]]</p>
<p>After washing and using the toilet, detainees had breakfast, which was either eaten in their cell or at the canteen. Detainees were given very little time to eat, [[[VERY LITTLE TIME TO EAT: 3, 6, 19 + ADD]]] and many reported they got very little to eat or drink. [[[INSUFFICIENT FOOD AND WATER: +ADD]]] “They didn’t give us water at night. I was thirsty all the time. We got just half a cup [of water] at meals,” [Pseudonym Y8] told Amnesty International. [[[Y8]]]</p>
<p>“Red” songs were nearly always sung before meals and often throughout the day (see below). [[[19, 35]]] After breakfast, detainees attended a flag-raising ceremony. [[[19]]] During the ceremony, detainees stood at attention and sang the national anthem. [[[6]]]</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-exercise-fresh-air-and-natural-light">Insufficient exercise, fresh air, and natural light</h3>
<p>The majority of survivors reported rarely, if ever, being allowed outside during their detention, except when walking from their cell to classes if the classroom was in another building. [[[NEVER ALLOWED OUT: 10 (2months), 37 (9 months08, 27 (female), 6 (female), 35, F2 (never in first facility, yes in second facility, which was a party school) +ADD]]] A minority were given a short time outside each day, often to do “military exercises”. [[[EXERCISE: 41 (escorted people outside); 66 (did military exercise every day);31 +ADD]]] Some were not allowed out at all for the first few months in the camps; later, they were given a few minutes a day during the remainder of their internment. [[[10, 21]]] Some were given time outside every couple of weeks. [[[5]]] A guard who worked at a camp said new detainees were not allowed outside during the first three months of their detention, and then were allowed a half-hour outside per day. [[[23 (guard)]]] [Pseudonym E2] told Amnesty he was not permitted outside at all during the first half of his year-long detention, but in the second half was permitted some time.</p>
<p><strong>“[For the first six months] we never saw sunlight. We were always in cell. Only during interrogations [did we leave our cell]. One corner of the cell had [a window], but it was covered by a dark net. You could see a bit of the sky… We sat still all day. We ate food in our cell… The beds were in one room. Then there was another door beside the toilet, [which goes to a small area] with fresh air. There was a metal net [over this area]. We had one hour a day in this [outside enclosure]… before 2018 we would sit still all day. After 2018 we would sit still and then be allowed into that area.”</strong> [[[44]]]</p>
<p>For internees who walked to class in another building, that was often the only time they got to walk or leave their rooms during the day. [[[19]]] “The second camp was worse because there was no walk to class [because classes were in our room], so we were never outside,” [Pseudonym] said. [[[19 (larger point here is that he could never move)]]] A few survivors said that the only time they were ever outside was to empty the bucket that he and his cellmates urinated in. [[[Bucket disposal only time to go outside: +ADD]]] [Pseudonym B2], who was sent to the camp because she had WhatsApp on her phone, told Amnesty she was never able to get any exercise or have sunlight or fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>“There was no fresh air. There was no sunlight. The windows [in the cell] were blocked…. The only opportunity to go outside was to take the trash out. We were never outside, except at the very beginning when there were few people. Once more people arrived we never went out… and once the number grew they stopped taking us to the canteen and brought food to our room.”</strong> [[[27]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 65], who was detained for a reason related to religion, told Amnesty that during the three months he was detained in the first facility he was sent to, the only time he went outside was during an “evacuation” drill in case of an earthquake. “When we got out into the yard we saw so many police pointing their guns at us, like we were enemies in a war.” [[[65]]]</p>
<p>Survivors often reported that their rooms were very cold. [[[COLD: U1 (heating didn’t work); 29 +ADD]]] [Pseudonym 68], who was sent to camp in one of the coldest parts of China, told Amnesty he spent part of the winter in a cell with no heat, and that the shoes detainees were given were very thin and provided nearly no warmth. “It was really, really cold,” he said. [[[68, 17, 72, 19]]]</p>
<p>Many survivors reported that there was little or no natural light in their cell. [[[LITTLE OR NO NATURAL LIGHT IN CELL: 68 + ADD]]] The rooms usually had either no windows or one very small window, often covered. [[[68]]] “There was a metal net over the window so no finger can reach the glass. And the window was covered by communist slogans. You couldn’t see outside… we sat in a chair the whole day from December to April… during these four months we never saw the sun,” [Pseudonym 53] said. [[[53]]]</p>
<h3 id="night-duty">Night ‘duty’ </h3>
<p>At around 9 or 10pm, detainees were given a few moments to wash and use the toilet, and then they went to bed. Talking was forbidden at night. Some survivors reported being made to sleep head to toe so they would be unable to communicate with each other at night. [[[Head to toe]]] “You couldn’t talk. They regulated [how we were positioned when we] slept so that we couldn’t talk – your head was [positioned] next to someone’s feet,” [Pseudonym X5] told Amnesty International. [[[C27 (check)]]]</p>
<p>All detainees were required to “work” one- or two-hour shifts monitoring their cellmates every night. [[[NIGHT DUTY: 19, 6, 8 + ADD]]] The shifts were spent either walking continuously back and forth or around the cell, or sitting still on the edge of the bed. One survivor reported that he was instructed to reposition people’s heads or lower the bedding if someone was not sleeping with their face visible and facing the camera. [[[cite]]] Some survivors claimed this policy was instituted to ensure no one killed themselves. [[[SUICIDE PREVENTION]]] Several had no idea why they were on duty.</p>
<p>[Pseudonym A4], who was arrested for allegedly failing to get permission to travel domestically, told Amnesty that at night, internees were responsible for monitoring each other and for ensuring their faces were always visible to the CCTV cameras in the cell:</p>
<p><strong>“The lights [in the cell] were always on. At 10pm we had to lie in bed. Two cellmates were on night watch. From 10 to 12, 12 to 2, 2 to 4, and 4 to 6… these two people are [always] walking between the window and the door. Their job was watching us. At night we had to sleep with head facing the camera and face uncovered. And if not they woke us and put us in the right position.”</strong> [[[A4]]]</p>
<p>Even when not on duty it was difficult to sleep because of regular noise from the loudspeaker in the cell, and because the lights in most cells were always on. [[[8]]] [Pseudonym 72 told Amnesty how he never got more than a few hours sleep at night during the year he spent in a camp.</p>
<p>“Normally we sleep from 10pm to 5am. And we are on watch for two hours a night. … And cadres and police came into our cells [late at night a couple times a week] and ordered us to write confessions. … And the light was on 24/7. It was a strong light and it disturbed our sleep. We never got enough sleep… They claimed it was [a school] … but how can you learn anything if they don’t let you sleep.” [[[72]]]</p>
<h2 id="education-in-internment-camps">4.3 “Education” in internment camps </h2>
<p>The government of China has referred to the internment camps as “vocational training” or “transformation-through-education” centres. The part of the day not spent eating or sleeping – usually 12 hours – was devoted to so-called “re-education”. The re-education in the camp was normally delivered via lectures in classrooms. In many cases, however, formal classes did not begin until an internee had been at a camp for several weeks, and often not for several months.</p>
<p>At some point after arriving in the camp, nearly all detainees were subjected to highly regimented classes, either in person, via video lectures, or both. The classes were mostly about Chinese language, history, law, and “ideology”. Some involved memorizing and reciting “red” songs; that is, revolutionary songs that praise the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Republic of China. The typical schedule included three or four hours of class after breakfast. Then detainees had lunch and a short “rest”, which often involved sitting still on a stool or with their heads still on their desks. [[[6]]] After lunch there was another three or four hours of classes, and then dinner, followed by a few hours to sit or kneel on a stool and silently “review” the day’s material or to watch more “educational” videos. [[[19]]] At nearly all times during classes, internees were required to look straight ahead and not to speak with their classmates.</p>
<p>Classes were usually held in classrooms beyond the cells. Inmates from two or more cells were regularly brought together in one larger class with approximately 50 people. Survivors also reported having classes in their cell.</p>
<p>Internees often had to line up or sit and wait for hours in the morning because of the logistical constraints of transferring thousands of people from cells to classrooms, especially when they had to walk through narrow fenced enclosures – in essence cages – to get from the building where their cells were to the building where the classrooms were. [[[6]]] [Pseudonym A3] told Amnesty he spent a large portion of the day waiting to be escorted to class: “After classes started, we got moving at 6am. It took two to three hours to send all inmates to class. The class was 1km away. The cage line, beginning from the dorm [and leading] to the class, was really narrow, we could only walk single file. It took two to three hours for everyone to get there.” [[[A3]]]</p>
<p>While walking to the classroom – or anywhere else in the camp – internees had to walk between yellow lines painted on the ground of the facility. [[[LINES ON GROUND: 17, 19, 5, 12, 47 + ADD]]] Anyone who stepped on or over the lines risked physical punishment. [Pseudonym X6], who had been sent to a camp because she refused to work for the government, told Amnesty she remembered a staff member speaking about the two yellow lines on the floor of the camp. The guard reportedly said, “‘You people went outside of the path. [In this camp] you will learn to go inside the path.’” [[[19]]]</p>
<p>Internees were escorted to class by guards. Some guards had shields and electric batons. [[[47, 68]]] When travelling from the cell to the classroom, internees sometime walked outside to another building but were almost always in some sort of caged enclosure. “The roads from the dorm to the classroom were surrounded by wires and armed guards who looked like they were ready to shoot you,” [Pseudonym] said. [[[13]]] Internees were often required to march to class in a military-type formation, shouting slogans. [[[54]]] [Pseudonym 19] told Amnesty that inmates were required to march to and from class “like soldiers” and that while marching they were required to shout, “study hard, elevate yourself, eliminate separatist forces, and long live Xi Jinping!” [[[19]]]</p>
<p>The teacher and guards entered the classroom using one door and the students entered through another, which, like the cell doors, was chained to the wall. Classes began and ended with the class thanking the teacher for their sacrifice. [[[35]]] Students and teachers were physically separated at all times. Classrooms had a hard plastic, wooden, or metal divider, over a metre high, separating the students from the teachers and ‌guards. [[[DIVIDERS: 6, 7, 13, 17, 19, 28, ,54, 66, 23, 47, 27, 13, 68, 53 +ADD]]] A wire or metal net often filled the space above the divider. Some survivors reported that there were multiple guards with weapons in the classroom with them at all times. [[[GUARDS IN CLASS: 6, 19 ,54 ,66, 42, 8, 19, 68, 13 + ADD]]] “[In my class] there were three guards on the same side as the teacher. They wore police uniforms… They wore bullet-proof vests… They had a metal shield that was about 1m high… One had a long spear; it was longer than the guard’s height.” [[[66]]]</p>
<p>Desks and stools in the classroom were often attached, and sometimes chained together. [[[DESKS CHAINED: 6, a3, 13, 17, 27, 13, 54 +ADD]]] Survivors reported being given short pencils to write with, or the plastic tube of ink and tip from inside a disposable pen; they presumed this was because a full-size pencil or a pen could be used as a weapon. [[[47]]] [Pseudonym W1/2] described his experience in the classroom:</p>
<p><strong>“Every day was almost the same… We were brought to a place where you had to sit for 17 hours. It was in another room in the same building. [In the classroom] there were five or six armed guards and a teacher. The door to the class was also chained, you must crawl to get in. … The teacher was behind a barrier, maybe neck height. You could see them but you couldn’t cross [the barrier]. The guards were on the teacher’s side. They taught us verses from Confucius. We had to read [the verses] out loud and repeat them hundreds of times. And there were loudspeakers in the classroom. Several times I heard [a voice on the loudspeaker saying] ‘give more pressure’.”</strong> [[[8]]]</p>
<p>Internees were made to sit absolutely straight while at their desks. Survivors reported people being taken out of class and beaten or otherwise punished if they did not sit straight and look straight ahead. [[[12]]] [Pseudonym 19] told Amnesty International that failure to sit straight could also affect an internee’s score: “We had to sit straight with our hands behind our back. In our classroom, there were old women. Their hands and feet swelled up. If you missed your home, if you cried, they would deduct from your score – they gave scores to everyone – and they would say that your mind still had problems, that your ideas didn’t change.” [[[19]]]</p>
<h3 id="language-training">Language training</h3>
<p>Teaching Chinese was a primary objective of the “education” that detainees received in the camps. Speaking in any other language was forbidden and was a punishable offense. Language classes took up the majority of the time in a day. Nearly all survivors reported having to regularly pass language exams and being required to learn a certain number of Chinese characters – often 3,000 – before being released. [[[LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: 19, 47, 10, 11 (rumour) + ADD; This is consistent with leaked government documents: https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/]]] This is consistent with leaked government documents, which stipulate regular examinations and state that test scores “will be aggregated to form study points, which are used to evaluate the effect of the education and training and form the main basis to determine whether a student has completed (their course).” [[[https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510/China-Cables-Telegram-English.pdf, para 10]]] Inmates who failed to memorize words or songs were often physically punished. [[[LANGUAGE PUNISHMENTS: 5, 12, +ADD]]]</p>
<p>Detainees were sometimes divided according to their language abilities; however, many survivors who spoke fluent Chinese reported being forced to sit in basic classes and many survivors who did not speak any Chinese reported not understanding anything said in class for months. [[[8 – older person]]] Many detainees expressed difficulty with the classes. “The classes were mainly Chinese language, but it wasn’t helpful. Each day they just wrote hundreds of characters on the board. We just copied. No one tried to explain,” [Pseudonym] told Amnesty International. [[[find]]] “We were under pressure to learn 3,000 characters. There were many exams. I graduated high school and it was hard for me. It was very hard for old people, and for farmers,” [Pseudonym D1] told Amnesty. [[[42]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym], who spent a year in the camp for visiting Kazakhstan and for an alleged offense related to religion, told Amnesty how the language classes involved rote memorization:</p>
<p><strong>“During the class there was a Han teacher who wrote Chinese characters on a board and we just copied it without knowing what it was. That was it. We just wrote characters… It was just language… we were not allowed to speak Uyghur in class. If you did [speak a language other than Mandarin] you got punished. You were taken to a room with a tiger chair… I was taken twice.”</strong> [[[P1]]]</p>
<p>The survivors’ accounts of language classes are consistent with testimony given by other survivors and with leaked government documents. [[[insert]]]</p>
<h3 id="political-education"> ‘Political education’</h3>
<p>Most survivors reported attending some combination of history, law, and ideology classes or, as many survivors referred to it, “political education”. These classes focused largely on forcibly indoctrinating detainees about the “evils” of Islam and about how prosperous, powerful, and “benevolent” China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and President Xi Jinping are. [[[IDEOLOGY CLASSES: 19, 26, 43, 8, 6, 42, 7, + ADD]]] These classes were often taught by government officials or delivered on video by state-approved imams talking about religion, or judges and lawyers speaking about what the state classified as terrorism, extremism, and separatism. Many also involved films of CCP sessions or speeches by Xi Jinping, or propaganda plays about families turning into “terrorists”. Significant portions of the classes were devoted to red songs about the greatness of China, the CCP, or Xi Jinping. [[[21, 26]]] Some detainees were made to sing for hours on end, until their throats become sore. [[[13]]] They were punished for not singing or for singing the songs incorrectly. [[[PUNISHED FOR NOT SINGING +ADD]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 51], who was arrested for downloading WhatsApp and buying an illegal SIM card, told Amnesty he believed the classes were structured to prevent detainees from having and practising their religion:</p>
<p><strong>“I think the purpose [of the classes] was to destroy our religion and to assimilate us… They said that we couldn’t say ‘As-salamu-Alaykum’ and that if we were asked what our ethnicity we should say ‘Chinese’… They said that you could not go to Friday prayers. … And that it was not Allah who gave you all, it was Xi Jinping. You must not thank Allah, you must thank Xi Jinping for everything.”</strong> [[[51]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 7], who was arrested for his relationship to a “suspicious” person, told Amnesty International he attended classes focused on pushing people away from Islam and from travelling abroad, and towards certain common social habits perceived to be “Chinese”.</p>
<p><strong>“They taught us not to visit other countries, to stay in China. That going abroad might give you the wrong ‘ideology’. They told us to start smoking and to drink alcohol. If you don’t [drink and smoke] it is a sign of being religious. We were told not to go to mosques when we were released, that you could get 20 years [in prison]. … They told us to only greet people in Chinese. And to only have your children watch Chinese television.”</strong> [[[7]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 5], who was sent to a camp for reasons related to religion, told Amnesty his classes focused on the supposed “problems” with Islam.</p>
<p><strong>“We watched videos by… an official religious figure, about how we should follow the country’s law… there were three or four videos that we watched on repeat… In the video he says ‘… there is no such thing as</strong> <strong>jihad, don’t follow the terror idea, it is illegal to kill or do violence.’ We watched [the same] video for four hours a day, or for the whole day if there was an inspection.”</strong> [[[5 (check)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 27], who was arrested for having a forbidden messaging application on her phone, told Amnesty that afternoons were spent in a class she described as propaganda about the greatness of China.</p>
<p><strong>“[T]here were ‘law’ classes, but it was not really law, it was ideology… it was about how a country should have one language… about how China was great and excellent, and how Kazakhstan was bad… And [they would show us a big] bridge that China built… and talk about fighting terrorism, and how those in the [re-education] camps were terrorists themselves. … They were brainwashing us to say that without the Chinese Communist Party there was no China, no prosperity, and that Xi Jinping was great. … They made us sing ‘Xi Jinping is the father of China, father of the world’.”</strong> [[[27 (check)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym XX], who was sent to multiple camps, told Amnesty that at the first camp he was made to watch videos about all the things the government did to help the poor and about all the sacrifices people made for China in World War II.</p>
<p><strong>“They also told us ‘it took 39 million people to die to build a new China, and you Uyghurs are only 16 million… why are you Uyghurs looking for something bad? Why don’t you enjoy your life?’ They used to show us wars between China and Japan. They used to make us write essays about how we thought and felt about the movie, what we thought about millions of deaths to build a new China. They repeated the same movies every day. They told us not to bite the hand that feeds you, and don’t spit in the water you are drinking. We would ask what our crime was. They would</strong> <strong>say ‘the fact that you are talking back right now is a crime in itself,’ that you shouldn’t speak. We would sit there quietly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Three or four people came during the day and lectured us. They would make us memorize communist slogans, law, and tell us that the Communist Party was good. We had to sit and listen and memorize… In the second camp they would show us photos of Uyghurs who left to Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, and say that this guy is in prison for so many years, this guy for so many years. They said that if you go [abroad] we will catch you and detain you… This is how they would make the day go.”</strong> [[[XX (check)]]]</p>
<p>The survivors’ accounts of language classes are consistent with testimony given by other survivors. [[[insert]]]</p>
<h3 id="interrogations-forced-confessions-and-self-criticism">Interrogations, forced ‘confessions’, and ‘self-criticism’</h3>
<p>Detainees were questioned or interrogated regularly. The manner and frequency of the interrogations appears to vary widely from camp to camp and person to person. Some survivors reported being interrogated once or twice during their entire stay; others reported weekly interrogations. As during the interrogations in police stations and detention centres (see Chapter X), the interrogations in camps focused on the internees’ religious practices, foreign contacts, and relationships with “suspicious” people. [[[Interrogations: 19, 17 +ADD]]] Numerous survivors reported being forced to “confess” to their “crime” during interrogations; some told Amnesty they had actually done what they were being accused of (for example, travelling abroad, downloading WhatsApp) so while they did not consider their actions criminal, they considered their confession to be honest. [[[Confess during interrogations: 8 +ADD]]]</p>
<p>Pseudonym 66 told Amnesty International that they were periodically told to write four types of reports. “<strong>We</strong> <strong>had</strong> <strong>to write</strong> <strong>experience reports</strong> <strong>(xindetihui</strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong>心得体会), which</strong> <strong>was</strong> <strong>mainly</strong> <strong>about</strong> <strong>our</strong> <strong>feelings</strong> <strong>after watching videos of Xi Jinping’s speeches, the 19<sup>th</sup></strong> <strong>CCP</strong> <strong>Congress, or</strong> <strong>other political</strong> <strong>propaganda videos.</strong> <strong>Another report was called statement of repentance (huiguoshu /</strong> <strong>悔过书), in which</strong> <strong>we</strong> <strong>used to</strong> <strong>write about how</strong> <strong>we</strong> <strong>regret that they have committed those mistakes,</strong> <strong>in my case it was</strong> <strong>installing WhatsApp, which could potentially bring harm to</strong> <strong>the leadership</strong> <strong>of the CCP and the country</strong>. <strong>We also wrote letters of apology</strong> （rencuoshu / 认错书) <strong>and guarantee</strong> (baozhengshu / 保证书)<strong>, where we would</strong> <strong>acknowledge what we have done was wrong and basically guarantee the conditions of our</strong> <strong>release from the camp, promise that we would not talk about anything about camps.”</strong></p>
<p>Many interrogations took place in rooms where internees sat across a desk from a government official and did not involve any explicit ill-treatment. Many others took place in punishment rooms, which were usually in the basements of the camp, and often involved torture and other ill-treatment (see Chapter X). [Pseudonym 10], who was arrested for working in Kazakhstan, told Amnesty how he was interrogated in a room in the basement of his camp:</p>
<p><strong>“[Security agents] took me to an underground room and put my legs into an iron bar. My hands were handcuffed to the chair. They asked me about my biography. Where was I born, when did I start school, where did I go after high school, what did I study. I told them I went to Kazakhstan. They asked me how many times I visited and where I went, and where I stayed. They asked for the names of my relatives, and what [my relatives] did, did they pray? … They asked which cities in Kazakhstan I visited, which countries I visited. They also asked about [my siblings]. … They asked ‘when you were in Kazakhstan did you learn how to pray?’”</strong> [[[10]]]</p>
<p>Internees were also regularly required to write “confession” or “self-criticism” letters in which they admitted to their “crimes”. Some survivors reported having to write self-criticism letters once or twice during their internment; others reported this was a weekly or biweekly activity. [[[34]]] Survivors reported being given a list of crimes – usually 75 – from which to choose two to “confess” to. [[[13, 17 + Examples + see shahit letter for an example of this.]]] Journalists have also reported there were 75 types of crimes to choose from. [[[Reported here: https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/898563.shtml; also UHRP has a translated version of the list]]] Survivors told Amnesty they believed that people who chose – or were made to choose – certain crimes, particularly crimes related to religion, were given prison sentences (see Chapter X). [[[13]]]</p>
<p>In addition to confessing one’s crimes, as part of the self-criticism, internees were made to describe in writing what they had done wrong, to explain that as a result of the education they were receiving they had recognized the error of their ways and that their thoughts had been “transformed”, to express gratitude to the government for the education, and to promise not to return to their old habits. [[[40]]] [Pseudonym 40], who was put in a camp for having contact with people who had “extremist” thoughts, said he was forced to admit his crime and that he was told that if he did not confess he would be sent to a punishment room. [[[40]]] “Once a month there was self-assessment acknowledging that you did a crime and that you are not a good person,” [Pseudonym XX] told Amnesty International. [[[XX (check)]]] [Pseudonym 13] also told Amnesty he was forced to choose two crimes from a list of 75 to confess to:</p>
<p><strong>“They started teaching us about 75 [crimes]</strong> [[[Other people mentioned this – y2; https://archive.fo/XLxqi]]]<strong>… We had to write our names and IDs and to choose at least two. The more the better… What I read is that it is a crime not to drink and not to smoke. And that thick [rope] – to bind straw – if you have too much then it is a crime… you have to choose which you have… for example, if you brought too much food at once to your house… and if you visited a mosque not in your hometown, it is a crime… I visited a mosque in another county to attend a funeral… So I chose two. And I put my fingerprint on it.”</strong> [[[13]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym X7], who was in a camp for a year, told Amnesty that civil servants who lived outside the camp, and who she likened to case managers, used to come to do interrogations and what she referred to as “self-assessments and confessions”, in which detainees were required to confess to their crime, reflect on their “progress”, and often to disavow the religion of Islam.</p>
<p><strong>“At the beginning [the civil servants] would tell you your crime – [mine were] having WhatsApp [and travelling to Kazakhstan] – then you had to write: ‘I didn’t know having WhatsApp was a crime. I didn’t know it caused damage to the CCP. Because of WhatsApp my mind was ‘compromised’. Now, after this education, I am getting better. I will not have WhatsApp on my phone again. … [My other crime was going to Kazakhstan. I had to write:] I was in Kazakhstan. I got infected by ‘ideas’. Now I will do better and get rid of ideas. … And [we also had to write] we had mistakenly chosen the religion of Islam. We will not choose this religion again. … And there was also a list of ‘misdoings’ of Muslim believers against China. For example, praying before bed. So you would have to write that you were sorry for this and that you would not do it again.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X7] told Amnesty International she was required to do a self-assessment once a week. “It was the same every week, except that you must acknowledge some progress, like learning Chinese,” she said. [[[X7 (check)]]]</p>
<h2 id="health-care-without-consent">4.4 Health care without consent</h2>
<p>All survivors experienced health-related measures without their consent. This occurred both during their pre-detention health check and during their time in the camp. Nearly every survivor reported being given injections and having their blood drawn. [[[EXAPLES OF INJECTIONS AND BLOOD DRAWN: 5, 19, 48, 51, 56, 61, 68, 72,+ADD]]] Almost none were told what the injections or blood samples were for, even after they asked. “They injected me with a liquid, to clean inside my artery. They didn’t have my consent. They said that if I didn’t [allow them] then they would put me in the strict group,” [Pseudonym x40] told Amnesty International. [[[X40]]] A few were told that some of the injections were flu shots or vaccinations. [[[FLU SHOTS +ADD]]]</p>
<p>There is a widespread belief among detainees that they were being injected for other reasons: to affect their memory or to sterilize them. [[[BELIEF that being sterilized]]]</p>
<p>While government documents indicate that detainees were required to be vaccinated, the frequency with which some detainees report being injected is suspicious. [[[SUSPICIOUS FREQUENCY OF INJECTIONS: 68, 48, 61, 19 + ADD]]] A few survivors claimed they were give injections or made to take pills every couple of weeks. “I can’t remember exactly [how frequent the injections were] but it was approximately every 10–15 days,” [Pseudonym 68] said.” [[[68]]] “They give pills regularly in camp. Sometimes every 2–3 weeks. You didn’t know what the pill was – no box, no paper – just blue pills. Everyone gets them… I heard that they prevent you from having child,” [Pseudonym 19] told Amnesty international. [[[19]]]</p>
<p>Survivors remarked that after people received injections they were “happy” or seemed inebriated. [[[6, 10]]] “All of us were injected [before entering the camp]. They explained that is was to prevent the flu… After the flu shot people looked happy. I’m not sure why,” [Pseudonym F2] told Amnesty International. [[[6]]] Many journalists have also documented instances of detainees being injected repeatedly without explanation.

<p>Most survivors reported becoming sick and weak while in the camps. Most claim they did not receive adequate health care. Many report developing chronic health problems. [[[68]]] Many stated that after leaving the camps they could no longer sit for long periods without being in pain. [[[13]]] Many stated that after leaving the camps they had problems with their memory and with sleeping.

<p>According to these reports, these aggressive forms of population control are closely intertwined with the internment camp system, which is used both to intimidate women into compliance and to punish those who refuse to submit to these measures.

<p>Four survivors told Amnesty International they were not interned in a formal camp, but instead spent the majority of their internment detained in hospitals. [[[HOPSITALS: 31, 33, 15 + ADD]]] These included three older survivors who were kept inside hospital rooms for nearly a year. They were nominally told to learn Chinese, but reported essentially just sitting in the room for months on end. [Pseudonym S1], an older woman, told Amnesty how she spent most of her detention in a hospital room with other older women, none of whom were permitted to leave the floor.</p>
<p><strong>“I was at the hospital the whole summer… it is the [top] floor of a normal hospital, but it is blocked from other floors, and the windows are barred, only doctors can come in and out … I was kept in a room with six other elderly people. … We were not allowed to go outside … We spent most of the day just sitting on our bed. … We had lessons but I had problems hearing and my eyes were bad; they didn’t pressure me. They just demanded that I sign my name in Chinese… and we had to sing ‘red’ songs.”</strong> [[[15]]]</p>
<p>Similarly, [Pseudonym 33], also an older woman, was kept in a hospital room with a group of such women for several months. She told Amnesty how they spent the time:</p>
<p><strong>“[During the day] we would wake up and have breakfast in the room. We were handed papers and books. I pretended to read, but I didn’t understand anything. We would pretend to learn all day. Then we would have a meal and sleep. They taught some ‘red’ songs. They wanted us to learn Chinese words. We weren’t allowed out. We just wanted to be released. We were only allowed to go to the toilet. Otherwise we stayed in the room.”</strong> [[[33; – interviewed already - https://shahit.biz/eng/#view]]]</p>

<h3 id="transformation-through-education">‘Transformation through education’</h3>
<p>At its core, the “transformation through education” regime detailed in this report is a system of detention functioning both to punish detainees for certain behaviours and to reintroduce them into “normal” society following “rehabilitation”. Much about the system draws upon Chinese penal practices that have been in place for decades, and many of the human rights violations that survivors describe are endemic features of other Chinese detention systems.</p>
<p>Different forms of compulsory re-education of individuals or groups considered to be politically “unreliable” or threats to social stability have existed in China since 1949. In the late 1950s, a new system of custodial re-education known as “re-education through labour” (<em>laodong jiaoyang;</em> RTL) was introduced to deal with “minor counterrevolutionaries” and “rightists”. In the 1980s, the focus shifted to include drug abuse, prostitution, and juvenile delinquency.</p>
<p>RTL enabled police to confine people without judicial trial for periods of one to three years (with the possibility of a one-year extension) for a broad range of unlawful acts considered too minor for criminal prosecution. Millions were locked up under conditions barely distinguishable from – or sometimes even worse than – prisons. Codified regulations and a formal process of hearings gave the institution a veneer of legality, but the lack of judicial trial or, in most cases, legal representation made the deprivation of liberty under RTL inherently arbitrary under international law. Further, RTL was often imposed in a brutal and humiliating fashion, and RTL facilities were a place of additional human rights violations, including compulsory labour, torture and other ill-treatment. [[[]]]</p>
<p>Though RTL functioned as a key part of local authorities’ stability-preservation toolkit for decades, its incompatibility with official professions of “rule according to law” and commitments to human rights made it a target of Chinese legal reformers. Those reformers claimed victory when RTL was abolished as an institution in December 2013, but the practice of depriving individuals of their liberty for extended periods under the guise of “education” has continued in different forms since then.</p>
<p>For example, even before 2013 authorities throughout the country had been using “legal education classes” (<em>falü xuexiban</em>) to detain people arbitrarily for periods lasting months. Like their counterparts in Xinjiang, these detention sites (which, like RTL, have been used extensively against practitioners of Falun Gong), were claimed to provide “classes” or “training” but operated without clear regulations, laws, or other public directives to explain their use or operation or how and on what basis individuals were incarcerated there.</p>
<p>The immediate domestic basis for the facilities in Xinjiang appears to be Article&nbsp;14 of the De-extremification Regulations enacted by the Standing Committee of Xinjiang People’s Congress on 29 March 2017, which describes several components of “transformation through education” in superficially positive terms:</p>
<p><strong>“Eliminating extremism necessitates doing the work of transformation through education well, combining individualized education with education in vocational training centres; legal education with “help and education” (<em>bangjiao huodong</em>); ideological education, psychological counselling and behaviour modification with the study of the national standard spoken and written language, law and technology; and transformation through education with human care to enhance the effectiveness of transformation through education.”</strong></p>
<p>However, this regulation cannot serve as a basis for deprivation of liberty under Chinese law. Article&nbsp;7 of China’s Legislation Law makes clear that deprivation of liberty may be based only on laws passed by the National People’s Congress or its standing committee. Though the regulation clearly considers transformation through education to be a form of help and education (<em>bangjiao</em>) authorized under Article&nbsp;29 of the Counter-Terrorism Law of the PRC, there is no legitimate way to reconcile the complete deprivation of liberty associated with transformation through education facilities in Xinjiang with the community-based education, surveillance, and support that help and education ostensibly entails.</p>

<h1 id="torture-in-internment-camps">5. Torture in Internment Camps</h1>
<h2 id="types-of-torture-and-other-ill-treatment-in-internment-camps">5.1. Types of torture and other ill-treatment in internment camps </h2>
<p>Every camp survivor Amnesty International interviewed was tortured or subjected to other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (in this report referred to as “torture and other ill-treatment”) during their internment. Torture and other ill-treatment are constitutive elements of life in the internment camps. The torture and other ill-treatment that detainees experience in the camps fall into two broad categories.</p>
<p>The first category includes the physical and non-physical (that is, mental or psychological) torture and other ill-treatment experienced by <em>all</em> detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps. This treatment includes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day,</p></li>
<li><p>sleep deprivation, and</p></li>
<li><p>insufficient food, water, exercise, health care, sanitary and hygienic conditions, fresh air, and exposure to natural light.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“re-education” under threat of severe punishment itself,</p></li>
<li><p>not knowing when their detention will end,</p></li>
<li><p>not being able to communicate freely with their family or anyone outside the camp,</p></li>
<li><p>not being able to speak in their native tongue,</p></li>
<li><p>living under the constant threat of violence and other abuse, and</p></li>
<li><p>being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these physical and non-physical measures, in conjunction with the total loss of control and personal autonomy in the camps, is likely to cause mental and physical suffering severe enough to constitute to torture. or other ill-treatment. <del>The overall environment</del> <del>and</del> <del>setting</del> <del>also</del> <del>leads to a total absence of</del> <del>any safeguards against torture</del> <del>or other ill-treatment,</del> <del>in violation of the absolute prohibition</del> <del>of such treatment in international human rights law.</del> The camps are in fact designed to ensure that these types of torture and other ill-treatment are an inescapable aspect of daily life for every detainee. [[[For other accounts of this type of torture see: https://www.fairobserver.com/region/asia_pacific/XUAR-uighur-muslims-internment-camps-china-human-rights-news-54321/; https://believermag.com/weather-reports-voices-from-XUAR/; https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-exporting-persecution-uyghur-diaspora-haunted-by-anxiety-guilt-as/; https://jamestown.org/program/evidence-for-chinas-political-re-education-campaign-in-XUAR/; https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/secret-chinese-documents-reveal-inner-workings-muslim-detention-camps-n1089941]]]</p>
<p>The second category of torture and other ill-treatment includes physical torture and other ill-treatment that occurs during interrogations or as punishment for misbehaviour of <em>specific</em> internees. Torture methods used during interrogations and as punishment included beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, being hung from a wall, being subjected to extremely cold temperatures, and solitary confinement. Amnesty International documented one account of a death in an internment camp caused by torture.</p>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed many survivors who were tortured or subjected to other ill-treatment during interrogations or punishments in internment camps. Amnesty also interviewed survivors who witnessed the torture or other ill-treatment of other detainees or spoke with other detainees – usually their cellmates – who informed them that they had been tortured or otherwise ill-treated during interrogations or as punishment.</p>
<p>Survivors and witnesses described a broadly consistent pattern of treatment of detainees by staff and other officials in the camps. Some of this treatment reflects patterns of torture and other ill-treatment that Chinese security forces have carried out in Xinjiang and other parts of China for decades.

<h3 id="torture-and-other-ill-treatment-under-international-law">Torture and other ill-treatment under international law</h3>
<p>States have a legal obligation to treat people in detention humanely and with dignity. [[[Article 10(1) of the ICCPR, 6 See Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, G.A. res. 45/111, annex, 45 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 49A) at 200, U.N. Doc.

A/43/49 (1988).]]] In addition, under international law, torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are absolutely prohibited and cannot be justified under any circumstances whatsoever. The prohibition, enshrined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the ICCPR, among others, has become a rule of customary international law, which is binding on states even if they have not ratified the relevant human rights treaties. It is also a peremptory norm, a <em>jus&nbsp;cogens</em> rule, with no reservations or derogations permitted. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), pp. 54-61.]]] It is not enough to simply prohibit and criminalize torture and, where appropriate, other acts of ill-treatment under national law; states must take a range of measures to protect people from, and prevent, these forms of abuse. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), Chapter 3.]]]</p>
<p>The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT), which binds China legally as a state party, is the primary UN treaty that is focused solely on prohibiting, preventing, and combating torture and other ill-treatment. Article&nbsp;1 of the UNCAT defines torture as</p>
<p><strong>“Any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions</strong>.” [[[CAT]]]</p>
<p>Unlike torture, “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” has not been defined in international treaties. This phrase originated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and was incorporated unchanged into the UNCAT. In approaching the question of what distinguishes such ill-treatment from torture, Amnesty International is guided by the principle that “[t]he term ‘cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses”. Amnesty International considers, in line with much of the jurisprudence of international and regional human rights monitoring bodies, that cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment may generally be described negatively in relation to torture; that is, as ill-treatment that “do[es] not amount to torture” because it lacks one or more of the key elements of the torture definition described above. An act or instance of ill-treatment would therefore constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment rather than torture if 1)&nbsp;it lacks the required intention, 2)&nbsp;it lacks the required purpose (or discrimination), or 3)&nbsp;the pain or suffering it causes is not considered “severe”. [[[See Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), pp. 74 – 75.]]]</p>
<p>Psychological or mental harm can constitute torture just as much as the infliction of physical pain. [[[Actions aimed at humiliating individuals or causing&nbsp;psychological suffering&nbsp;may constitute torture or inhuman treatment, and also violate the right to human dignity.]]] Courts have recognized that there is no necessary physical element to torture. [[[Cite legal articles]]] Psychological torture can include</p>

<li><p>threats</p></li>
<li><p>humiliation</p></li>
<li><p>intimidation</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Attempts to destroy a detainee’s sense of self by removing control over their environment (that is, “learned helplessness”) is also torture. [[[cecke]]]</p>
<p>The treatment of detainees is strictly regulated under international law. [[[In addition to the broad provisions contained in general human rights treaties, the UN and other intergovernmental organizations have developed comprehensive standards on conditions of detention over the years, including the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Mandela Rules); the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment; the UN Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners; and the UN Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (Bangkok Rules).]]] The prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment is recognized to include the prohibition of corporal punishment under international human rights law. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), pp. 84 – 88.]]] Force should be used in detention settings only when strictly necessary and proportionate to the legitimate objective to be achieved. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), Chapter 4.5.]]]</p>
<p>Prohibited interrogation techniques include stress positions or restraining the victim in a highly uncomfortable position. [[[See 9 CAT Concluding Observations: USA, UN Doc.CAT/C/USA/CO/2 (2006) §24]]] Blindfolding and hooding should also be prohibited, as should prolonged sleep deprivation, threats (including threats of torture and death threats), using cold air to chill the detainee, electrocution, and beating. [[[See UN Special Rapporteur on torture, UN Doc. A/56/156 (2001) §39(f); CPT Standards, 12th General Report, CPT/Inf (2002) 15 §38]]] Other forms of coercion include interrogation techniques designed to offend personal, cultural, or religious sensitivities. [[[UN Mechanisms Joint Report on detainees at Guantánamo Bay, UN Doc. E/CN.4/2006/120 (2006) §60.]]] Prolonged incommunicado detention and secret detention violate the prohibition against torture and other ill-treatment and are therefore forms of prohibited coercion. [[[2 UN Mechanisms Joint Study on secret detention, UN Doc. A/HRC/13/42 (2010), §§27-28, 292(f)]]]</p>
<p>Other techniques that may violate the right of detainees to be free from ill-treatment include withholding clothing or hygiene products, permanently keeping lights on in the cell, and sensory deprivation. [[[Asencios Lindo et al v Peru (11.182),]]] Intentionally depriving someone of food, water, or medical attention can also amount to torture. [[[N. Rodley and M. Pollard, ‘Criminalisation of torture: state obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’, European Human Rights Law Review (2006) p.120.]]]</p>
<p>Extracting “confessions” through torture or other ill-treatment is a serious human rights issue that must be addressed by bringing domestic legal restrictions on prevention and prohibition of torture into alignment with international law and standards, in particular the Convention against Torture. Statements obtained through torture or other coercive means may not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against the person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.</p>
<p>The revised UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) provide that permitted instruments of restraint should be used only as strictly necessary and proportionate to prevent harm to the individual being restrained or to others, or as necessary against escape during transfer; they are not to be used for punishment. [[[Revised UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 2015, UN Doc. A/ RES/70/175, rules 43(2), 47; UN Committee against Torture, Observations on the UN Standard Minimum Rules, arts, 36 and 37 (“The use of restraints should be avoided or applied as a measure of last resort, when all other alternatives for control have failed and for the shortest possible time, with a view to minimizing their use in all establishments and, ultimately, abandoning them… Immobilization should only be used as a last resort to prevent the risk of harm to the individual or others”); Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), pp. 57 – 58.. https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/POL3040362016ENGLISH.PDF; the Robbin Island guidelines: https://www.achpr.org/public/Document/file/Any/rig_practical_use_book.pdf]]] Other international standards prohibit the use of chains or irons and regulate the use of other restraints. [[[Rule 47 of the Standard Minimum Rules]]]</p>
<p>It is essential that detainees be kept in conditions that ensure their physical and mental wellbeing. They should not be kept in overcrowded conditions or subjected to extremes of heat or cold. They must have access to natural light and fresh air [[[Rules 13, 14 and 23 of the Mandela Rules; CPT Standards, CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2015, p. 25, §30. (https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/175)]]] and to exercise, recreational, religious, and other facilities. Rule&nbsp;44 of the Mandela Rules defines solitary confinement as “the confinement of prisoners for 22&nbsp;hours or more a day without meaningful human contact”. International standards and experts increasingly favour restriction or even elimination of solitary confinement, in particular as a punishment. [[[Amnesty International, Combating torture and other ill-treatment: a manual for action (Index: POL 30/4036/2016), Chapter 4.5.5.]]] Depending on the specific reason for its application, conditions, length, effects, and other circumstances, solitary confinement can constitute torture or other ill-treatment. [[[Special Rapporteur on torture report, UN Doc. A/66/268 (2011) §80.]]]</p>
<p><del>According to Article 7(2) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the crime against humanity of torture is “the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions”, committed within the context of a widespread or systematic attack directed at the civilian population. Unlike torture as defined in Article&nbsp;1 of the UNCAT, there is no purposive requirement that the ill-treatment be committed for a specific purpose, or a requirement that the ill-treatment be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In addition, the Rome Statute does not explicitly differentiate between torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as the UNCAT does. Nevertheless, the ICC has held that a conviction of the crime against humanity of torture will require “an important degree of pain and suffering”</del> [[[Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute ICC-01/05-01/08 15 June 2009 para 193]]] <del>, implying that the threshold under the UNCAT may apply. However, the ICC has also held that it will not judge the severity of each incident of ill-treatment; instead, it will consider the cumulative effect of a course of conduct.</del> [[[Prosecutor v.

<p>Though China ratified the UNCAT in 1988, it has failed to bring domestic legislation in line with the obligations of the treaty. The Committee Against Torture, the UN expert body charged with overseeing the treaty’s implementation, has repeatedly raised concerns about a number of issues in China, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>arbitrary detention where there is a high probability of torture and other ill-treatment;</p></li>
<li><p>torture and other ill-treatment of human rights defenders;</p></li>
<li><p>lack of a definition of torture in domestic laws that accords with that of UNCAT;</p></li>
<li><p>failure to effectively exclude at trial evidence obtained through torture and other ill-treatment; and</p></li>
<li><p>lack of independence of judges and lawyers. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA1727302015ENGLISH.PDF]]]</p></li>

<h2 id="survivor-accounts-of-torture-and-other-ill-treatment">5.2 Survivor accounts of torture and other ill-treatment </h2>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed XX camp survivors – X women and XX men – who were tortured or subjected to other ill-treatment during interrogations or punishments. [[[TORTURED: 17, 12, 37, 35, 19 (f), 27 (f), 29 (f), 65 + ADD]]] This usually took place in interrogation or punishment rooms. These rooms were usually windowless and contained at least one tiger chair, which is used for interrogations. Three survivors reported that tiger chairs were brought into their cells. [[[IN CELL 24 + ADD]]] Three other survivors reported being punished in rooms with multiple tiger chairs. [[[MULTIPLE TIGER CHAIRS: 12, 37, 65 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>X survivors told Amnesty they were interrogated or punished in a tiger chair or other metal chair. [[[TIGER CHAIR: 3, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 (f), 27(f) 29(f), 31, 35, 37, 38, 44, 65 + ADD]]] Interrogations usually lasted an hour or more; punishments were often much longer. X people reported being left restrained in a tiger chair for 24 hours or more. [[[24+ HOURS: 29, 30, 37 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 12], who was detained for an offense related to the practice of Islam, told Amnesty International that during the year he spent in an internment camp he was taken to punishment rooms twice, where he was immobilized in a tiger chair. The first time was for making his bed too early in the morning. The second time, he was taken along with the rest of his cellmates, who were punished collectively because one member of the cell had spoken in Kazakh.</p>
<p><strong>“[The first time] I was taken I was on ‘night duty’ with an old Hui man. It was morning. We thought it was time to start making the beds. Then, on the loudspeaker, someone said it wasn’t time to start making the beds. Then [two guards] came into the room and took [the two of us who were on duty] to the [punishment] room. The room had eight [tiger] chairs. We were there for maybe five hours. We did not have water. There was no food. And no toilet. They opened the window. It was very cold. We stayed strapped in the chair. The chair is metal, and we were cuffed with arms straight out. Our legs were cuffed. … The second time, there was a guy [in my cell] who spoke in Kazakh. And the guards asked him if he spoke in Kazakh. And he said ‘no’. And then they took [everyone in the cell] to the tiger chair.”</strong> [[[12]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 29], an older woman who spent a year in the camp without ever being given a firm reason for her arrest – although she believes it was because she had gone to Kazakhstan – was taken to a punishment room because she had argued with a cellmate after trying to come to the defence of another woman who was hard of hearing and was being verbally abused. She described being taken by two female guards to a small, dark, cold, and windowless room in the basement of the camp, where she was handcuffed and shackled and made to sit in an iron chair for days:</p>
<p><strong>“Two women took me to the room. They held me under my arms. They told me to sit in an iron chair. … [They] cuffed my arms and legs. … My hands were cuffed to each other, not to the chair... [I was taken because] there was a woman [in my cell] who couldn’t hear well. And there was another Uyghur woman [in the cell] who used to call her names. I said [to the Uyghur woman], ‘Why are you taking advantage of her? You shouldn’t do that!’ [Then an argument started.] Then the guards came [in the cell] and asked us what happened and they took me to this room. … It was a dark room. No toilet in it. Just a bucket. … There was no bed, just a chair. They brought one piece of bread and water. I was getting pretty cold. I started shouting that I was getting cold. … My hands and legs were cuffed [to the chair]. … They told me I would be there for five days. [But] the following day they took my cuffs off and brought food. And [the guard] watched through the door and told me to eat. But I was cold and couldn’t eat. … I was there for three days.”</strong> [[[29]]]</p>
<p>Detainees told Amnesty International they were sent to punishment rooms multiple times. [Pseudonym 37], a farmer, described to Amnesty how he was tortured multiple times in two camps during his time in detention – both during an interrogation and during multiple punishment sessions. He described his interrogation session:</p>
<p><strong>“That day two guards came to my cell. They said I would be interrogated. I stuck my hands out through the hole in the wall [door] and they cuffed me [from the other side of the door]. … [I could hear] the guards talking on the walkie-talkie saying that ‘Guobao is waiting’. … Two guards took me from the cell and dropped me off [at the room where I was interrogated]. Two men were inside. They locked the door from inside. The guards were in uniform but the plainclothes [Guobao officers] interrogated me. … They started asking about personal information, ethnicity, date of birth, when I went to Kazakhstan, my occupation. … [they asked] ‘Did you pray there? What do your parents do?’ I said I only stayed with family, that I took care of livestock, and that I didn’t do anything illegal… they asked me about mosque and praying. … If I told them I had been praying, I had heard that I would get sentenced for 20 or 25 years. So I told them I never prayed. Then they became upset. They said, ‘All that time with livestock, you became an animal too!’ Then they hit me with a chair until it broke. … I was sitting on a chair and they hit me with another chair. They hit me until the chair broke. I fell to the floor. I almost fainted. … Then they put me on the chair again. They said, ‘this guy hasn’t changed yet, he needs to stay [in the camp] longer’… then they walkied the guards, who helped me back to the cell.”</strong> [[[37]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 37] was also sent to two punishment rooms on multiple occasions for trivial offenses.</p>
<p><strong>“[The first time I was taken in the first camp] it was because I tried to look out the window. There was a window with a bar [in my cell]. We were not allowed to look outside. … [The first time I was sent in the second camp] was because they made me the responsible person for the cell. Leaders were inspecting the cell. When they came in [to inspect our cell] we had to stand up and show respect but my cell didn’t do it so I was sent to a punishment room. … [The second time I was sent to the punishment room in the second camp] was one day before I was released. It was because I didn’t sit still in the classroom.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 37] was tortured in both camps. He told Amnesty he was repeatedly electrocuted while being asked repetitively whether he “would do it again”. “[I had to say that] I made a mistake but will not do it again,” he said. “The first time they electric shocked me. Then they tied me up on a chair for 24 hours without food or water… The second time they chained me up [from the wall].” He told Amnesty he was left immobilized in a tiger chair multiple times, and the room was very cold. “They would open the window on winter days,” he said. [[[37]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 37] also described two of the punishment rooms, one of which had 20 tiger chairs.</p>
<p><strong>“You can see the chair across from you, but not beside you because there are [wooden] dividers [that go to the ceiling]… Above every tiger chair there is a camera and microphone and a small white light. The light is on the ceiling. Lights are dim… There is a window but no light. The window is close to the ceiling. It is very narrow. … Everything was white. The walls, floors, ceilings. All new… It is in the basement where we live. … There were several other people [in the room] but I could not see [most of] them. There was one guy in front of me. I could see him. The other guy [in front of me] was punished for using his Kazakh mother tongue. … We talked to each other. We had to talk in Chinese.”</strong> [[[37]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 65] also described being punished and sent to a place with numerous tiger chairs – in this case they were in a corridor of a building in the camp:</p>
<p><strong>“I was punished once… In class I raised my hand and asked a question, then [the teacher] threw a plastic ruler at me and said, ‘Why do you speak!’… then [the teacher] said to the guards to take me to the tiger chair. … They tied my hands and legs to the chair… I was lucky [because I wasn’t there for too long]… There were 10–15 chairs… It wasn’t a real room; it was part of a corridor. … There were partitions between the chairs, like in a public toilet. You could not see the chair beside you… There was another person in front of me [who I could see]… When the guard left, I asked the man in front of me how long he had been there. He said 24 hours.”</strong> [[[65]]]</p>
<p>Solitary confinement was used in the camp as a form of punishment. In some cases, this punishment could include confinement in tiger chairs<strong>,</strong> with the person immobilized in the chair left alone for close to a day or longer. In one case, a survivor stated that the camp she was interned in had a “dark”, tomb-like room, which was windowless and without light, about two metres by one metre, where detainees were sent if they misbehaved. She told Amnesty how she was put in the room for two days:</p>
<p><strong>“On that day a 70-year-old lady spoke her mother tongue, Uyghur, in our cell… The guards wanted to take her to a tiger chair. I argued with them… They said that I hadn’t learned and still had extremist thoughts, so they put me in the dark room… It’s just a room for one person. I was just lying on the floor… When you lie down [with your head at one end] your feet almost touch the wall… There is a toilet in the room, nothing else.”</strong> [[[66]]]</p>
<p>Physical ill-treatment also takes place throughout the camps outside of interrogation and “formal” punishments, most commonly through beatings, the use of restraints, and the use of pepper spray. Guards routinely beat detainees who “misbehave”, even for the most trivial offences. Amnesty International interviewed XX people who reported being beaten during detention. [[[BEATINGS: 37, 17, 18 (interviewed before), 14, 16, 35, 17, 7, 28 (f), 27 (f), 72 + ADD]]] Electric batons were often used to electrocute and beat people. [[[ELECTRIC BATONS: 28, 37 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym C2] told Amnesty how he was beaten shortly after arriving at the camp when he resisted being strip-searched by guards:</p>
<p><strong>“When I said I wouldn’t take off my underwear they beat me with an electric baton. And then I fell. They beat me and I was electrocuted… when I came to my senses, they took off my clothes, they searched me, made me bend down, tied my hands behind my neck. It was very painful.”</strong> [[[28 (check to make sure not in a prison)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 17] told Amnesty he was severely beaten after fighting back against a guard who hit him with a rifle:</p>
<p><strong>“[One of the guards] said, ‘squat and put your hands on the back of your head!’… I asked why. Then the police hit me with the back of a rifle… I wanted to protect myself so I hit back. He fell down. Then the other police all hit me. When I was being beaten up I heard one voice saying, ‘end him with one bullet’... I thought I was going to die… I wanted not to be killed and I screamed… then they sprayed something in my eyes so I couldn’t open them… Then I was dragged [to my cell].”</strong> [[[17]]]</p>
<p>Two survivors reported having their legs shackled during part of their time in detention. [[[LEGS SHACKLED: 32 (first 15 days), 38, 44 (first year) + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 32] told Amnesty his legs were shackled for 15 days after he was initially detained. [[[32]]] [Pseudonym 44] told Amnesty his feet were shackled together for the first year he was in a camp.</p>
<p><strong>“It was a metal chain with 11 links. The two ends on my feet with bolts. [It weighed about] 3kg. We could barely step 20cm or more. I could barely walk. It was on 24/7. Every week the guards would check the chain. Every two weeks they would tighten the bolts… [Several months after I arrived in the camp] they offered us water for showering, but always with the chain on. The old inmates showed us how to take your pants off. We took our pants off through the space between the chain and ankle, but it takes a really long time.”</strong> [[[44]]]</p>
<p>Three survivors told Amnesty International that they were sprayed with something, likely pepper spray, while they were in the camps. [[[PEPPER SPRAY: 28, 17 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym] told Amnesty he was sprayed with something while being interrogated twice while immobilized in a tiger chair. “I was taken [from my cell] to another room and seated in a tiger chair… they didn’t ask me anything. They sprayed something in the air that made it difficult to breathe. [The spray] was small, like [the size] of a bottle of pills. You could put it in your pocket,” he said. [[[17 (?)]]] [Pseudonym] told Amnesty that guards used to spray a white substance, which he believed was pepper spray, into his cell frequently – multiple times a day – which made his throat sore and made it difficult to breathe. [[[28]]]</p>

<h2 id="witness-accounts-of-torture-and-other-ill-treatment">5.3 Witness accounts of torture and other ill-treatment</h2>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed X woman and X men who directly witnessed the torture or other ill-treatment of other detainees. [[[WITNESSES of TORTURE: 24(tiger), 28(death), 41(heard), 51, 52, 54(beat/torture), 61 (tiger), 66(tiger), + ADD (check with above)]]] [Pseudonym 28] told Amnesty he witnessed the torture of a cellmate whom he later learned died from the effects of the torture. [Pseudonym 28] said the man was made to sit in a tiger chair in the middle of their cell. The cellmates were made to watch him sit there, restrained and immobilized, for three days, and were expressly forbidden to help him.</p>
<p><strong>“He was a [ethnicity redacted]. I can’t remember his name. There are many things I can’t remember [since I left the camp]… [The man] was in our room for more than two months, then he was taken to the doctor – I think he was taken for high blood pressure and because he fainted… As soon as he came back [to our cell] he was made to sit in a tiger chair. [I think the man was being punished for pushing a guard.]… They brought the chair into our room… Yes, we were watching. They told us that if we helped him then we would sit in the chair… It was an iron chair… his arms were cuffed and chained. Legs were chained as well. His body was tied to the back of the chair… Two half [cuffs] were locked around his wrists and legs… A rubber thing attached to ribs to make the person [sit] up straight... at some point we could see his testicles. He would pee and poo in the chair. He was in the chair for three nights… He died after he left. We found out through [people] in the cell… He didn’t die in front of us. After 72 hours, he was peeing and pooping. We told the guards. They said to clean him. His bottom was wounded. His eyes look unconscious… Then [the guards] took him [out of the cell].”</strong> [[[28]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 64] told Amnesty he witnessed two of his cellmates immobilized in tiger chairs for extended periods of time. He and the other cellmates were forced to watch and forbidden from providing any assistance:</p>
<p><strong>“They used to make people sit in tiger chairs for hours. I saw it with my own eyes. They used to make the person sit in the tiger chair in front of us. They used to bring the chair into our cell if someone was not obedient… It happened twice. The first guy [was immobilized] for 24 hours. He was not allowed to eat or drink. He was taken to the toilet twice… The second guy was made to sit for six hours.”</strong> [[[64]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 61] told Amnesty now she and her cellmates were forced to watch others sit in tiger chairs, including one who urinated on herself after being made to sit in the tiger chair for 32 hours: “A female guard used to take us [to another room in camp] to show us how people were suffering… It was in a room [that was originally intended] to keep animals, surrounded by bars. It was dirty… It was like a pound. It was made of bricks with an iron roof… I saw them sitting in the chair.” [[[61]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 54] told Amnesty he saw immobilized people tortured through the use of restraints and exposure to the cold while walking from his cell to the medical clinic in the camp: “I saw how they torture [other people]. One time they set a young lady in a metal chair outside [in January] in thin clothes… [I saw] seven Uyghur men handcuffed [outside] to metal bars and chain on their feet without shoes.” [[[54]]]</p>
<p>Survivors told Amnesty that they witnessed other inmates shackled. [[[WITNESSED OTHERS SHACKLED: 44, 32 (check), 41, staff + ADD]]] [Pseudonym 95], who also worked in an internment camp, told Amnesty that all detainees in the strict and very strict management categories in the camp she worked in had to be shackled at all times. [[[staff]]]</p>
<p>Numerous survivors witnessed other internees being beaten, including older internees. [[[WITNESSED BEATINGS: 1, 26, 51, 7 (older), 72, + ADD]]] Beatings were often punishment for moving when they were required to sit still, not speaking in Mandarin, or not learning appropriately during classes. [Pseudonym 72] told Amnesty how men in his cell were routinely beaten for minor movements.</p>
<p><strong>“They ordered us to stay still, to ‘sit tight’, but it was so cold that it was impossible. … If you made any motion, they would beat you…. You can get beaten for any reason. … If someone moved and you tried to explain [to the guard] that the man was innocent then you would be beaten too. … I don’t even count the [frequent] slapping and punching as beating. … They beat people at night, they took them to the basement… There was a room without cameras… I saw guard dragging motionless men back to [our cell and to the cell across from ours]. … I saw four guys [being dragged liked this]. … One guy in our cell was beaten unconscious. … He had a mental problem… They [took him out of the cell] and beat him until his skin was broken.”</strong> [[[72]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 51] told Amnesty that guards routinely beat people as they walked to class and how a man in his class was taken out of class and beaten for not singing a song properly:</p>
<p><strong>“[Name redacted] was beaten, he was an ethnic Uzbek; a Han Chinese [guard] beat him and put him in isolation for 24 hours… he came back with bruises. I was in his cell… and [the guard] would call people who could not recite Chinese content to the door [then the person who was called would stick their hand through the hole in the door] and then cuff them to the door and beat them with an electric baton… I saw [people being beaten] two or three times… I could hear [people being electrocuted] in the hall many more times.”</strong> [[[51]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 23], who worked in a camp, told Amnesty that internees were regularly beaten in his camp. “Every day someone was taken out [of the class] and beaten, with hands, feet, weapons, and baton,” he said. [[[23 (guard)]]]</p>
<p>Journalists and human rights organizations have reported additional witness accounts of torture and other ill-treatment. [[[Merdan Ghappar witnessed people with black cloth bags over the head; handcuffs; shackles; and a steel chain between the handcuffs and the shackles and said people were beaten until “their skin opened and they couldn't sit down.” – NEED TO GATHER MORE HERE]]]</p>
<h2 id="second-hand-accounts-of-torture-and-other-ill-treatment">5.4 Second-hand accounts of torture and other ill-treatment</h2>
<p>XX survivors and other witnesses provided Amnesty International with accounts of torture and other ill-treatment that they themselves did not witness. These second-hand accounts were received from other camp survivors – usually their cellmates – who were tortured or otherwise ill-treated during interrogations or as punishment. [[[SECONDHAND ACCOUNTS: 1, 5,6, 11, 12,13, 25, 26, 27,28, 31, 32, 35, 36, 41, 42, 47, 57(?), 61, a3 + ADD]]] Survivors described cellmates being taken to punishment rooms and immobilized in tiger chairs – often for several days – and being beaten during interrogations. [[[26]]] Many returned with visible injuries and stories of torture.</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 61] told Amnesty that women in her cell were punished by being made to stand still and look at the wall for hours. [[[61]]] [Pseudonym 42] told Amnesty that another internee in his cell told him he was taken to a punishment room and hung on the wall with his feet off the ground. [[[42; 17 (said he saw chains to hang people); 31 (second hand hanging)]]] [Pseudonym 66] told Amnesty she spoke with a male camp survivor who said his entire cell was taken to tiger chairs. [[[66]]] [Pseudonym 35] told Amnesty other internees would be taken out of her cell and return with physical injuries:</p>
<p><strong>“Some people would disappear for several days. When they came back their bodies were scarred… I know one, because her bed was next to me. She disappeared… [when she came back] her hands were swollen… She said don’t talk to me because there are cameras in the cell… [but she did talk later and said that] two police tortured her. She said she was beaten. They also beat her on the soles of her feet.”</strong> [[[35]]]</p>
<p>Many detainees said their cellmates appeared to have been punished for very trivial offences. [Pseudonym 13] told Amnesty, “In the second facility we had no lessons… we had to sit straight without moving… you can’t even look to the side… one man was taken away [for looking to the side] and came back with swollen feet and legs and he said he was taken and cuffed to a bed and beaten.” [[[13 (check if taken away because he looked)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 11] told Amnesty International that she spoke with a friend who said she had been raped repeatedly by internment camp guards.</p>
<p><strong>“I was terrified when I found out that I would be sent to a facility, because my neighbour, who was in her twenties, was at a camp, and she and I had a drink and she shared her secrets. She said she was raped and forced to have an abortion… She told me that she said several Han people raped her, that ‘two held my hands, two held my legs and one raped me’.”</strong> [[[11]]]</p>

<h2 id="the-process-of-being-released-from-an-internment-camp">6.1 The process of being released from an internment camp</h2>
<p>The process to determine whether detainees are released from camps is not well understood, including by many detainees. Much like the process surrounding the initial detention and transfer to the internment camp, aspects of the release process appear to be extra-legal, such as the total absence of any transparent criteria or legal assistance and protection. Nothing that survivors experienced during the time leading up to their release indicates any regard for the fairness or due process required for deciding individuals’ fates of such gravity.</p>
<p>Leaked Chinese government documents, particularly the Telegram, provide some insight into how the government intended – at least at one point – the release process to work. [[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html, para 17]]] Based on testimony from survivors and witnesses and on what we know from the Telegram, the decision to release or transfer someone is essentially the culmination of a process that begins when a detainee is first detained. From that moment, there is an ongoing process of monitoring and evaluation, whereby people are given scores (see Chapter&nbsp;X). A detainee’s behaviour reportedly affects his or her score, which factors into the release determination.</p>
<p>According to the Telegram, once a detainee arrives at an internment camp there are five broad criteria that must be met to be designated as ready to be <em>considered</em> for release from the camp. The detainee must have</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>been placed in the normal management group,</p></li>
<li><p>been in the camp for at least a year,</p></li>
<li><p>displayed some form of improvement with respect to his or her “problem” since arriving in the camp,</p></li>
<li><p>achieved adequate scores with respect to “ideological transformation, academic achievement, compliance and discipline, etc.,” and</p></li>
<li><p>no “other circumstances that affect completion.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once these criteria are met, a detainee can proceed to the first of several additional evaluations undertaken by camp and other government officials. First, “a student evaluation team overseen by the Party organization secretary” undertakes a “preliminary” evaluation and then checks the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (see Chapter 4) to see if it has flagged any “new problems”. Then, in the absence of any new issues flagged by IJOP, the case is reported “up level-by-level” to three different groups of government cadres, the last of which is the “local (prefecture, city) vocational skills education and training service bureau” that, in concert with “comrades of the local [Party] committee”, makes the final determination about whether the detainee is ready for “completion” and ultimately release.</p>
<p>The decision to release a detainee is also based in part on the behaviour of the detainee’s family outside the camps, which is also being monitored, evaluated, and incorporated into the detainee’s score. A 2017 government directive on how to answer questions from minority students who wonder where their relatives are instructed cadres to tell the students that their behaviour could hurt their relatives’ scores. [[[The New York Times, ‘Absolutely No Mercy’: Leaked Files Expose How China Organized Mass Detentions of Muslims (The Xinjiang Papers), 16 November 2019, www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-XUAR-documents.html.]]] Survivors also said that after they were released they learned their family and friends had been questioned before their release and that their family members had to fill out a long questionnaire. [[[27 (maybe expand this quote, but this woman has a lot); 26; 66]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 69], a government cadre who assigned scores to families in her village, told Amnesty how cadres also scored family members of people in internment camps, and that family members were told that if they went to work in specific factories or attended Chinese language classes it would increase their scores. Although [Pseudonym 69] was personally sceptical that detainees were ever released early because of good behaviour by their family members, she was instructed to inform family that it could. Moreover, according to [Pseudonym 69], when men were sent to camps, authorities would pressure their wives to work in factories.</p>
<p><strong>“If [a woman] refused then they threatened that her husband’s situation would be worse... under my supervision there were [a few dozen] woman who were taken to factories like this. Many of them also had no choice because they needed the money [since their family lost income when their husband was sent to a camp camp].”</strong> [[[69]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 9], who worked in a village administration office and was responsible for looking through the files of people who had been sent to camps, explained to Amnesty how detainees were held responsible for the actions of their family members outside the camps, and how family behaviour could lower the score of the individuals, which is the metric the government uses to determine who should be released.</p>
<p><strong>“When someone was [sent to a camp] it affected</strong> <strong>three generations</strong> <strong>of the family. For example, if parents were sent then it affected the son – he could not get a job with government or police… Also, for example, the cadres staying with [the families of people in camps] overnight had to report back to the village committee if anyone prayed. And if they found this, then the score [of the person in the camp] would be lowered<em>…</em> And if a person was sent to re-education camp then that person’s family had to attend classes. If they did [attend] then the family would get a good score and [the person in the camp would] get released sooner, or vice versa. We collected scores each week and sent them to re-education camps<em>.</em>”</strong> [[[9]]]</p>
<p>According to the Telegram, if the detainee was designated ready for release, the group that did the final evaluation also determined whether the detainee entered a “skills improvement class” for “intensive training” before being released. [[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Exposed: China’s Operating Manuals for Mass Internment and Arrest by Algorith (“The China Cables”), 24 November 2019, https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm , “The Telegram” available at: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6558510-China-Cables-Telegram-English.html, para 18]]]</p>
<h2 id="survivors-experiences-of-the-release-process-before-being-sent-home">6.2 Survivors’ experiences of the release process before being sent home</h2>
<p>Detainees were not made explicitly aware of the government’s criteria for release; however, they generally understood that their behaviour was constantly evaluated. Many were informed that their release was predicated on achieving certain goals, such as learning a sufficient number of Chinese characters. [[[36, 42]]] Many also understood that breaking any camp rules would likely prolong their detention.</p>
<p>Despite their awareness of the evaluation, very few survivors credited their release to anything that they did or did not do in the camps. Most attributed their release to factors largely or entirely outside their control, such as their Kazakh ethnicity and the fact that the government decided to release ethnic Kazakhs from the camps. [[[26]]] Some believe they were released because of appeals for their release made by family members living abroad. [[[cite]]] Some have no idea why they were released. [[[39]]] “They released 12 people the day I was released… They said, ‘your time is up and you can go home now.’ They didn’t say why. They just released Kazakhs, not Hui or Uyghurs,” [Pseudonym XX] told Amnesty International. [[[cite]]]</p>
<p>Many survivors also believed their release was connected to the reason they were arrested; those arrested for certain “crimes” – especially religion-related offences – were believed to be much less likely to be released. [[[39 + ADD]]] This would be consistent with several other aspects of the mass incarceration campaign and the internment camp system. Because those sent to camps for religious reasons were generally classified in the strict or very strict management categories, it stands to reason that at the very least, it would take longer for them to progress from either of those categories into the normal management category, which, according to the Telegram, is a prerequisite for release.</p>
<p>The interviews and other procedural steps survivors have described undergoing before being released are broadly consistent with the process outlined in the Telegram. Many of the survivors were questioned by camp and other government officials before release, and often by several groups of officials from different government bodies. [[[40;;]]] According to [Pseudonym 26], who was arrested for having WhatsApp on her phone, the release procedure involved officials from several levels of government. “It’s like a parole hearing. Civil servants came to camp. They checked my documents, asked whether I improved, whether my family was complying. They asked your friends and your neighbours if you were reliable,” she said. [[[26.]]]</p>
<p>The questions asked in these pre-release interviews followed a similar script. Detainees were asked about their religious practices, their contacts abroad, and other topics they had been questioned about repeatedly throughout their internment. [[[ADD]]] Nearly all detainees were required to “confess” to their “crimes”, to acknowledge that their past behaviour was wrong, to express how much they appreciated the education they had received, to explain how their thoughts had been “transformed”, to swear they would not act that way again, and, often, to disavow Islam. [[[13 + ADD]]] Detainees were also required to explain what they were planning to do after they were released. [[[ADD]]]</p>
<p>Survivors believed that to be released they needed to answer all the questions in the way the government officials wanted, regardless of whether it was the truth. [Pseudonym X18] told Amnesty that in the weeks before his release, he was interviewed by four different groups of government officials – “school” level (that is, camp level), county level, prefecture level, and autonomous region level – all of whom asked him similar questions and, he believes, required certain answers:</p>
<p><strong>“All the [interviews] were the same. [They asked] ‘What did you learn? Have your thoughts transformed? Do you love China? What are you going to do when you are released? Do you appreciate your re-education?’ We had to answer all the questions positively or be sent to jail. We know this… Each [of the four interviews] was one to two weeks apart, and lasted for 30 to 60 minutes… When they [arrested] us they made up one reason [for our arrest] even though we didn’t do it… [Before you were released] you had to write something. [You had to start what you write] with that reason. Then you copied a form saying you wouldn’t pray, wouldn’t go to a mosque, and would follow all Chinese laws.”</strong> [[[47, 42 (check)]]]</p>
<p>Towards the end of the interview process, detainees were made to write and sign several letters and to sign several official documents, including a “confession” letter, a “gratitude” letter, and at least one document stating they would not disclose anything about their internment in the camp to anyone, including to members of their family, and especially not to foreigners. [[[SIGN: 10, 19, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 52, 61, + ADD survivors who didn’t sign, 19, 21, 68; see https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/china-ex-prisoners-horrors-XUAR-camps-uighurs for 28]]] Survivors said that they had to sign numerous documents before being released. “I had to sign 19 documents to be released,” [Pseudonym 12] said. [[[12]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym I2], who was arrested for travelling to Kazakhstan, told Amnesty International he had to write and sign three letters before being released.</p>
<p><strong>“Before I was released I had to write a letter of gratitude to the Party, thanking them for feeding and educating us. And I had to write a confession letter, saying that I committed a mistake by going to Kazakhstan… you needed three letters to sign out. [The third] said [I was] not allowed to say anything about our experience in the camp and that if I did then I agreed to be judged and sent back to the camp.”</strong> [[[26 – check if its’ actually the confession, the gratitude and THREE letter related to not speaking out, which is what 37 seems to say.]]]</p>
<p>All detainees were told unequivocally that if they disclosed information about the camps they would be interned again or sent to prison. [[[]]] Survivors were also told that their family members would also be sent to camps. [Pseudonym 47], who was released along with a large group of Kazakh detainees, told Amnesty International that before their release, camp officials told the group that if they disclosed anything about the camps they would be sent back to the camps along with their wives. [[[47]]] [Pseudonym 21] told Amnesty International he was required to write a letter of gratitude to the Party before being released and to swear not to disclose anything under penalty of his family being sent to a camp:</p>
<p><strong>“[During the final time I was interrogated in the camp], a few days before I was released, I had to write down everything that happened to me in the foreign country [I visited]. And to write about communism and democracy. I knew that we had to praise communism and despise democracy so that is what I did. And I had to write that if I ever spoke about what happened in the camp then my parents would be sentenced. Then I had to sign and put my fingerprint on the paper.”</strong> [[[21]]]</p>
<p>Some survivors were told to deny they had ever been to a camp. [[[6]]] A few survivors said they were coached on what to say to friends and relatives after they were released. [[[https://shahit.biz/eng/#view (Amnesty too),]]] [Pseudonym 35] told Amnesty International that before her release she was taken to a police station, where they put makeup on her and fed her. She was interrogated repeatedly over the course of a week, during which time they also told her what to do for the video they wanted her to make: “[Before I could be released] I had to make a video saying good things about the CCP and what they had done for me, and how strong the country was, and that the [overseas Uyghur organization] did terrorist activities, and the president of the [overseas Uyghur organization].” [[[35 (female)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 66] told Amnesty that to be allowed to go back to Kazakhstan she had to make a very detailed video stating that her time in the camp had been voluntary, that she was treated well in the camp, and that she had learned many valuable things during her time there, including why religion was bad. “I didn’t want to say these things. I had to say them to see my children,” she said. [[[66]]]</p>
<p>Family members of detainees were also threatened with detention if they spoke about the fact that their family members had been to a camp. According to [Pseudonym 9], who worked in a village administration office, family members of about-to-be-released internees received a call from government officials warning them not to disclose that their family member had been to a camp and threatening them with jail time if journalists ever found out anything about the family member’s internment. [[[9]]]</p>
<p>Once detainees fulfilled the necessary conditions, they were permitted to return to their homes; however, they had to do so under strict conditions limiting their movements and associations (see Chapter&nbsp;X). [[[Insert articles; also, 13 – release tih 200 , insert testimony. 26 – nov 2018 discharged all Kazakhs.]]]</p>
<h2 id="camp-to-prison">6.2 ‘Camp to Prison’ </h2>
<p>Like the process of being released to go home, to which it appears to be tied, the process through which camp detainees were given prison sentences is not well understood, even by former detainees who appear to have had some exposure to the process. It is also unclear how the release process and the sentencing process were connected, especially how, or if, the prison sentencing process in the camps is integrated with any formal sentencing process outside the camps.</p>
<p>Amnesty International was not able to interview anyone who was given a prison sentence in the camp and then sent to a prison. Amnesty did, however, interview camp survivors who were given sentences that were subsequently “forgiven”. [[[INSERT examples of testimonies that were subsequently forgiven:]]] Amnesty also interviewed survivors who said that while they were detained, one or more of the people in their class received prison sentences of three, five, or more years, [[[Q1 - Not given a verdict, but classmates taken to courtroom and sentence read aloud]]] including in some instances sentences of 15 or 20 years’ duration, for often everyday behaviour far removed from any type of recognized offence. [[[P1 – check this. – iman for 20 years; 19 - Woman in class sentences to 20 years, her husband prayed]]] Many of the survivors personally knew other people – usually multiple people – who had been given prison sentences.

</ul>
<p>[Pseudonym 70], who was living in Xinjiang in 2020, told Amnesty he believed that many people in the camps, particularly those detained for religious-related offenses, had been transferred to prison. “In September 2019 we started hearing that many Kazakhs had been released from camps but some were sent to prison for many years… I have information about 13 people [from my area] who were sentenced [and sent to prison]. Most of them were imams. I know some of them personally,” he said. [[[]]]</p>
<p>At some point during their internment, many camp detainees receive a “verdict” that lists their “crimes” and often includes a sentence. Survivors said the verdicts were given at the end of a process referred to as a trial. However, survivors that Amnesty interviewed did not experience anything that resembled a genuine judicial or even administrative process, let alone one that involved fair trial safeguards. Just as with their original detention in the camps, they had no opportunity to defend themselves, examine any evidence, or consult a lawyer. Some survivors did not recall any real process before they received a verdict, and said their verdicts and those of their classmates were just read out in class. [[[E2 (interviewed) - check]]] Some detainees were told that their sentence was expected to be served in the camp; others were sentenced and sent to prison.</p>

<h3 id="fair-trial-guarantees-under-international-law">Fair trial guarantees under international law</h3>
<p>The right to a fair trial, as recognized in Articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and expressed in detail in Article&nbsp;14 of the ICCPR and other international legal provisions, has become legally binding on all states as part of customary international law. When an individual is confronted by the machinery of the state, how that person is treated provides a concrete demonstration of how well that state respects individual human rights and the rule of law. The necessary safeguards are heightened if the individual faces criminal charges, trial, and sanctions (and the state's commitment is tested even more when a person is accused of threatening the security of a society, such as through acts of terrorism, or the security of those who hold power). [[[Amnesty Fair Trial Manual: https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/POL30/002/2014/en/]]]</p>
<p>Everyone, including those accused of criminal offences and victims of crime, has a right to equal access the courts, without discrimination. A fundamental principle and prerequisite of a fair trial is that the tribunal charged with making decisions in a case must be established by law and be competent, independent, and impartial. The right to a public hearing is an essential safeguard of the fairness and independence of the judicial process and is a means of protecting public confidence in the justice system, with only limited exceptions allowing closed trials. Even before any trial or sentence, anyone deprived of their liberty</p>
<ul>
<li><p>must be informed clearly and specifically of the reasons they are being deprived of their liberty, in writing and in a language the person understands;</p></li>
<li><p>must be promptly informed of their rights and receive an effective opportunity to challenge the legality of their detention before a judicial body that has the power to order the person’s release; and</p></li>
<li><p>must be given prompt access to independent legal assistance of their own choosing. [[[Article 9 of the ICCPR; HRC Concluding Observations: Sudan, UN Doc. CCPR/C/79/Add.85 (1997) §13; CAT General Comment 2, §13;]]]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If someone is charged with a criminal offence, other fundamental principles included in the right to a fair trial are the rights to be presumed innocent until and unless proved guilty according to law after a fair trial, and the right not to incriminate oneself, including by not being forced to "confess" guilt. If an accused alleges during the course of proceedings that they have been compelled to make a statement or to confess guilt, a judge should have the authority to consider the allegation at any stage. All those charged with criminal offences have the right to defend themselves, in person or through a lawyer. They have the right to be assisted by a lawyer of their choice, or to have a competent lawyer assigned to assist them.</p>
<p>No one may be convicted for an act or an omission that did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time it was committed. [[[Article 11(2) of the UDHR, Article 15 of the ICCPR, Article 19(1) of the Migrant Workers Convention]]] Punishments must be proportionate and may not violate international standards.</p>

<p>[Pseudonym T1] told Amnesty that while he was interned he was taken to a “court”, which involved him answering questions similar to those he had answered during previous interrogations. He was not given a sentence but many of his cellmates who were sent through the “court” were.</p>
<p><strong>“A month or so before I was released, people were taken to ‘courtrooms’ and given sentences… [when I was taken to the courtroom] they just asked me what I had done… I said I had been to Kazakhstan… [The woman presiding over the process] said you need more time [in the camp]. She didn’t give me a sentence… If I’m not mistaken she was a Uyghur. She had a list of questions... I was good at answering… It was just the two of us, talking in Uyghur… She already had documents about me in front of her… Everyone [in my cell] went to court. Some came back [to the cell] and said they got prison terms. Some were the same as me [and were not given any sentence]… Some of those who did [get sentenced] were then [moved out of the cell].”</strong> [[[16]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym E1], who was one of the few survivors who was temporarily placed in the strict management category and given a yellow badge, said that approximately a year into his time in the camp, several of his cellmates were taken to “court” and given sentences. “They took people to court. A few days later [those people] got verdicts. The staff in charge [of our cell] came to the cell and read the verdict. We can hear it read,” he said. [Pseudonym E1] provided Amnesty with the full names of two of his cellmates who were sentenced, and said that one was given 15 years for gathering with others and reading a book about religion and the other was five to seven years and six months for insulting the police and country leaders. [[[44]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym X9], who spent nearly a year and a half in different camps, told Amnesty International he was in a class of 50, which was approximately half Uyghur and half Kazakhs and Huis. He said that all the Uyghurs, five Huis, and two Kazakhs were given sentences. “They would read verdicts in class… [one man received] ‘three years for going to a halal restaurant’… [another man received] ‘seven years for you having camping equipment or boxing [equipment], because then you were involved in terrorism,” he said. [[[cite]]]</p>
<p>Not everyone who received a guilty verdict was sent to prison. It appears that some sentences were expected to be served in the camp. Two survivors told Amnesty International that people with verdicts under 10 years served them in the camp, and that people with verdicts over 10 years were sent to prison. [[[5 (intervewied); also 69 heard fromk survivors; 42]]] This largely corresponds to accounts reported by journalists. [[[https://www.dw.com/en/china-convicts-uighurs-in-sham-trials-at-XUAR-camps/a-53699982]]] It is also plausible that some verdicts were initially provided as scare tactics or that they could be altered with good behaviour. Most survivors Amnesty interviewed were initially given guilty verdicts, and a few were given prison sentences; however, those sentences were rescinded and none of the survivors Amnesty interviewed was sent to prison. [[[Also cell mates sentences rescinded - 2 people in his cell came back and said crimes – one guy had 8 years for prayer image on phone… 7 year for Kyrgyz flag… but those under 8 years all law released]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym D1] told Amnesty that people who received sentences of 10 years or more were sent directly to prison, including three men from his class – two Uyghurs and one Kazakh. He said he was told this secretly by staff in the camp. “Those verdicts over 10 years are directly sent to prison; the family gets the verdict. Those teachers in camp, they talked secretly to us [and told us that people were sent to prison],” he said. [[[42]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 19], who was in a camp for refusing to work for the government, told Amnesty International that officials started giving verdicts to people in her class several months after she arrived in the camp. “[Mine said] that I deserved five to 10 years, but that the government was merciful so I don’t need to go to prison… they said that my sin was going to a country that was on the sensitive country list and not cooperating with the neighbourhood committee.” [[[19]]] [Pseudonym 19] was subsequently released after an appeal from family members abroad.</p>
<p>[Pseudonym X76], who was sent to a camp because of his involvement with his local mosque, told Amnesty that one day while in class people were called one by one to another room and told what their verdict was:</p>
<p><strong>“People who were religious got [between] two- and 10-year prison terms. The person who was an imam in a mosque in my village was given a seven-year sentence [his name is…]... he told me about the sentence. We were in the same room… Initially I was given three to five years but then they forgave me and I wasn’t given a prison term… They didn’t explain why. Maybe because [a relative] did an appeal for [my release] from Kazakhstan.”</strong> [[[X76]]]</p>
<p>Amnesty also interviewed a former government official whose was responsible for informing families of people in the camps when their detained family members were given a prison sentence. “My job was to read it to the family members,” the official said. The official said that several government cadres, including one who was allegedly representing the judicial system, would go to the houses of families of people who had been sentenced. “We just read from a piece of paper. There was no [official] stamp or signature. Just the [crimes]… for each person it was different crimes. [Sometimes] the paper would say that the crime was one of the 75 signs of extremism,” [Pseudonym 69] said. [[[69]]]</p>
<p>The accounts of the release process given to Amnesty are consistent with accounts other survivors have provided to journalists. [[[Deutsche Welle (DW), China convicts Uighurs in Sham trials at Xinjiang Camps, 8 June 2020 , https://www.dw.com/en/china-convicts-uighurs-in-sham-trials-at-xinjiang-camps/a-53699982]]] Testimonies given to journalists refer to “sham trials”, which could lead people to be transferred from the camps to prison. As part of this process, detainees were handed a list of infractions from which they retroactively chose a crime for which they were detained in the camps – likely the 75 signs of extremism -- detainees who refused to choose a crime from this list were reportedly threatened with indefinite detention.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-for-prison-sentences">Reasons for prison sentences </h3>
<p>Testimony from survivors suggests that the original reason for a detainee’s detention in the camp appears to be a significant factor in the decision to release the person. Detainees interviewed by Amnesty generally believed that detainees sent to camps for religion-related “offenses” were more likely to have been given subsequent prison sentences. [[[https://www.dw.com/en/china-convicts-uighurs-in-sham-trials-at-XUAR-camps/a-53699982; cite amnesty examples.]]] Some detainees also believe that ethnicity was correlated with whether a detainee was sent to a prison, with Uyghur being perceived as more likely to be sentenced than members of other ethnic groups. .</p>

<p>According to the Telegram, after completing their “training” in the camp, detainees “will be sent to vocational skills improvement classes for intensive skills training for a school term of three to six months”. [[[Telegram]]] Local governments were responsible for designing and implementing the training in a manner that ensured detainees secured jobs shortly after leaving the camp in roles that took into account their “employment aspirations and the needs of society”.

<p>Despite this being described as a voluntary skills training and job placement programme, some detainees who spoke to Amnesty were, in fact, transferred from internment camps to situations of forced labour, including to factories in Xinjiang. Amnesty International interviewed ten survivors who were forced to do different types of labour after their release from a camp, including three who were sent to work in factories. [[[E1 (making government uniforms), o1, q1, n1 (maybe), 72]]] A few were made to work in village administration offices, police stations, or other government buildings, where they often performed menial tasks. [[[Q1 – 2 shahit admin testimonies, N1 (in village admin twice – check if also a factory account) , T1 (for four months), C1, Q1]]] One was made to work on a state-owned farm [[[A1]]] and one was made to do chores by cadres for a Han Chinese man in the village. [[[A3]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 5] told Amnesty that after spending six months [[[check]]] in one camp he was transferred to another camp, where he was taught to sew in preparation for being sent to a factory. He was then forced to live and work in a factory for several months, making government uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>“During the day [at the second camp] we would sit on a plastic chair. A teacher taught language and how to make clothes. During the 21 days [we spent in the second camp] we went to class two or three times, otherwise we were just in the cell… The teachers from the screen were in [a different] class. They just showed us how to make clothes on the TV. Some guys were there [in this camp] for two years and never touched a machine… Then a list came out for people to transfer to a factory. Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Uzbeks, not Uyghurs… Then I was sent to a factory for five months. To make government uniforms at first. Then we started making dresses. I worked for eight hours a day. I had one hour of exercise in the yard… I was allowed to call family and friends, but not people abroad… There was no physical inspection but we were given phones and asked to install a police app… We worked five days a week. The salary was</strong> <strong>1,620 RMB a month… We were really ineffective. We didn’t know how to do it. They had some Chinese woman come in for one week to try to teach us.”</strong> [[[5 – check this. (he was allowed out on weekends)]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym X10] told Amnesty he spent three months working in an ethnically segregated factory for low pay after being released from the camp:</p>
<p><strong>“[After I was released from the camp] they ordered me not to leave my house for 10 days… After a week they called me back and they registered me, and made a list of people who had been in the camp. Then they gathered all the people on the list and we went to a garment factory. We didn’t have a choice but to go there… The salary was low. It was impossible to take care of my family with the salary. The first month [we were paid]</strong> <strong>200 RMB…</strong> <strong>The factory was on the outskirts of [redacted] county seat. Only ethnic minorities were working in the factory – Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Hui. The [only] Hans were the heads of the factory... The factory made clothes, gloves, and bags.”</strong> [[[X10]]]</p>
<p>The three survivors who provided Amnesty with accounts of being sent to work in factories after being released from detention were all ultimately able to leave the factory. This was because of a government policy that allowed factory workers to return to their homes if they had secured another job and if another employer was willing to sign a guarantor letter taking responsibility for them. [Pseudonym X10] was permitted to leave the factory at night because he lived nearby, although other people were required to live there. Every week [Pseudonym X10] had to submit a written report of what he did [to the village administration].</p>
<p><strong>“I was at the factory for three months. After three months I asked if I could do my old profession. They said, ‘okay, but you need to get a letter from your work saying that they are taking responsibility for you and to give the address of the head of your workplace’… I got the paper [signed] and went back to [the place I used to work] after I finished</strong> <strong>school.”</strong> [[[13]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 13] told Amnesty he worked and lived in a factory for two weeks after being released from a camp. Some other workers in the factory had not been sent from camps; rather, they had been taken to the factory when another member of their family was taken to a camp:</p>
<p><strong>“They took us [to the factory]… there were many buildings and many people… I had to go to third floor… They taught us how to sew clothes. And while we were having lunch I spoke with women and girls [who worked there] and learned that those women’s husbands or girls’ fathers were in a camp, that was why they were taken there. I learned that if one family [member] was in a camp you have to work so father or husband can get out quickly… I worked there for [some] days…. I had been a businessman before. I explained that and they let me go… The name of the factory was [redacted]… it was in the county seat… it was a linen factory… we produced clothes.”</strong> [[[13]]]</p>
<p>Other survivors provided second-hand accounts of people from their camps being sent to factories. [[[I2, z; breadmaking factory (61 – five people sent)]]]</p>
<p>Journalists and scholars have reported that large numbers of detainees have been sent to situations of forced labour – inside and outside of camps – in Xinjiang and other parts of the country.

<h3 id="the-debate-around-the-current-status-of-the-internment-camp-system"> The debate around the current status of the internment camp system</h3>
<p>In December 2019, shortly after the publication of the China Cables and the Xinjiang Papers, Shohrat Zakir, Chair of Xinjiang regional government, announced that the “vocational training centres” (that is, the internment camps) in Xinjiang had been closed and that the people residing in those facilities had “returned to society.” [[[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/china-claims-detained-uighurs-have-been-freed; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/16/c_137535720.htm; https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/world/asia/china-XUAR.html]]] The government provided no evidence to support its sweeping assertions and, after the announcement, it continued to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent the public from obtaining information about the internment camps and the detained population. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/12/china-government-must-show-proof-that-XUAR-detainees-have-been-released/]]]</p>
<p>At the time of the government’s announcement, however, many of the facilities that had been used as internment camps had indeed been dismantled and a significant number of detainees had been released. [[[Cite satellite imagery analysis; note: ALL survivors interviewed had been released by that time.; https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/18/detainees-are-trickling-out-of-xinjiangs-camps/]]] There is debate about whether the dismantling of certain camps was a consequence of there being fewer detainees, because newer facilities had been built to replace some of the original buildings, or some combination of the two (see Chapter X.)</p>
<p>There is also significant debate about whether the decision to release at least some of the detainees was a consequence of a sea change in government policy or a result of what should be considered normal turnover for detainees who had already spent considerable time in the camps and fulfilled the criteria for being released.</p>
<p>It is also plausible that many of the detainees were released as a consequence of a policy change with respect to certain ethnic minority groups only, and, in particular, ethnic Kazakhs. Testimonial evidence from survivors’ family members strongly suggests that a significant portion of the ethnic Kazakh population detained in the camps has been released, particularly those with Kazakh citizenship or family ties to Kazakhstan. [[[See: https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/18/detainees-are-trickling-out-of-XUARs-camps/]]] This is plausibly the result of effective pressure on the government of Kazakhstan by civil-society groups in Kazakhstan to in turn pressure the government of China to release some ethnic Kazakh detainees. [[[See: https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/04/961387-concentrationcamps-china-XUAR-internment-kazakh-muslim/]]]</p>
<p>It is debated whether members of other ethnic groups were released at similar rates. It is plausible that significant numbers of members of other ethnic groups were also released, but their whereabouts remain unknown because they are unable to travel to a foreign country where they are permitted to speak relatively freely. Amnesty International is not aware of any survivors who were present in the camps after the government’s announcement in December 2019 who have spoken publicly; however, this may be due to that that none of the people detained during this time have been released into a situation where they are able to share their story.</p>
<p>Many survivors reported that Uyghurs were less likely to be released than Kazakhs. Most of the Kazakh survivors said the vast majority of the people released from their camps were Kazakh, not Uyghur, [[[18 (interviewed)]]] even though Uyghurs made up the overwhelming majority of the camp populations. [Pseudonym P1] told Amnesty that nearly all the Kazakh people were released from his camp: “I was one of the last [Kazakhs] in the camp because [I was in the camp for a reason related to religion].” [[[12]]]</p>
<p>The release of certain detainees and the absence of first-hand accounts from detained after December 2019 notwithstanding, camp survivors, family members of detainees, journalists, and scholars have argued that the government’s broad claims about the camps being closed are false. [[[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/world/asia/china-XUAR-muslim-detention.html]]] Credible evidence suggests that the camp system or, at the very least, a system of mass arbitrary detention is still operating and that many people remain detained in camps or in some other form of indefinite – and often incommunicado – detention, such as in prisons or situations of forced labour.</p>
<p>Testimony gathered by Amnesty and other organizations from survivors released before the government’s announcement and from friends and family of detainees indicates that detainees remain in the camps and that many others have been sent to prisons. [[[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/most-people-detained-in-XUAR-camps-have-been-released-china-claims; Find court docs (Shahit), and testimonies]]] <del>Scholars analyzing both the available testimonies from camp survivors and family members and public court documents have argued that while the government did begin to dismantle some of the internment camps and release some detainees as a result of international pressure, the situation of many detainees had gotten worse because they had been given long sentences and were transferred from internment camps to official prisons.</del> Evidence suggests that significant numbers of camp detainees have been transferred from camps to prisons; [[[Insert articles on prison transfers. … also on transfer to prisons in other parts of china: Shhret hoshur inajna authorie secretat transferre to jail thoughorugh china.

<h2 id="treatment-of-camp-survivor-after-release-from-internment-camps">6.5 Treatment of Camp Survivor after Release from Internment Camps </h2>
<p>After being released from the internment camps to go home, survivors were placed under electronic and in-person surveillance and subjected to regular evaluations from government employees and cadres. [Pseudonym 70], who worked with several former detainees after they were released from camps, told Amnesty International that government officials used to show up at his workplace and question his ex-detainee colleagues regularly. [[[70]]]</p>
<p>Camp survivors also faced further severe restrictions on their human rights, particularly their freedom of movement. These restrictions are in addition to the discriminatory policies directed at members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang (see Chapter&nbsp;1).</p>
<p>Family members of detainees also faced additional restrictions on their rights during and after the release of their detained relative. These restrictions included being subjected to additional surveillance, having their house searched, and having their movements further curtailed. [[[39]]] [Pseudonym Q1] told Amnesty he found out how his family’s freedoms had been curtailed while he was in the camp: “While I was in camp, I thought my family had freedom, but I learned that they were under house arrest. They had to ask permission to move… a cadre was consistently visiting their house… there was a camera in the street [in front of their house],” he said. [[[13]]]</p>
<p>Many survivors also reported being ostracized by their friends, family, and community after their release. [[[OSTRACIZED: 21, 27, 6, 39, 28, 42, 48 + ADD]]] [Pseudonym] told Amnesty that the social ostracization was a significant reason why he ultimately left China:</p>
<p><strong>“The reason I decided to come back [to Kazakhstan] was because after I was designated a ‘dangerous person’, even my friends and family were avoiding me. Everyone was trying to exclude me, even from social gatherings… And security people kept asking me questions. And [so did] the head of the unit where I worked… Although I never committed a crime they considered me a criminal.”</strong> [[[6]]]</p>
<p>The testimonial evidence about the situation of former detainees and their family members after release provided to Amnesty is consistent with evidence provided to journalists and other investigators as well as with leaked government documents prescribing the treatment of former detainees during the months after their release. This evidence includes a directive in the Telegram proscribing that every ex-detainee must be strictly monitored, evaluated, and controlled, and “must not leave the line of sight for one year” after leaving the camp. [[[https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/]]]</p>
<h3 id="re-education-continues"> ‘Re-education’ continues</h3>
<p>Nearly all former detainees were required to attend classes in Chinese language and political ideology after they were released. [[[MADE TO ATTEND CLASS: M1 (more stuff about xi jingping), f2 (mayb e day classes, 3x week) , p1, q1 (and family members too), u1, d1, 48, 27 (3x/week); 19 – articulate it as a spectrum from being out with restrictions to being in, woman who taught in camps; n1 + ADD]]] Members of ethnic minorities who had never been detained were also often required to attend classes; however, former detainees were normally made to go for two or three hours every day, and other members of the village were required to go twice a week. [[[53, 66]]] Family members of some detainees were also made to go to classes several hours a day. [[[9 – check quote]]] Ex-detainees reported that after they were released, during the classes they were required to continue to write “confession and self-criticism” letters and give them to local cadres to evaluate. [[[13]]] One survivor reported that Kazakhs and Uyghurs in her village were required to attend separate classes. [[[66]]] Han people were not required to attend classes. [[[66]]]</p>
<p>Many interviewees told Amnesty that all members of ethnic minorities were required to attend flag-raising ceremonies every Monday morning. [[[70; ATTEND FLAG RAISING: P1, Di, d2, Q1 (6-67 times) + ADD]]] During these ceremonies, ex-detainees were often made to publicly “confess” their crimes, to speak out against extremism, to apologize for being an extremist, and to extol the virtue of the education they had received. [[[PUBLICLY CONFESS: 3, 10, 13, 16, 27, 40, 66, M1 (psoke 4 times), d2,o1; t1 + ADD]]] Survivors told Amnesty that only ethnic minorities were required to attend the village flag-raising. According to [Pseudonym 19], members of the village who were not in camps were also required to go, but only ethnic minorities were truly compelled to attend: “Only Uyghurs go. Chinese people, they laugh at us,” she said. [[[19]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 66], who spent more than a year in the camps, was told to write and then read a statement praising the CCP and instructing others not to practise religion at a flag-raising shortly after she was released from the camps:</p>
<p><strong>“I was told to say… ‘I [Pseudonym 66] am the daughter of… I have been to a camp… because I made a mistake and now, with thanks to the Party, I have reversed my mistakes… and now I live in the right thanks to the Party. They put me on the right path.’ I also had to say that we shouldn’t be religious, that it is wrong. We shouldn’t pray. We should always follow the party.”</strong></p>
<p>Family members of internees also had to speak at flag-raising ceremonies. [Pseudonym C1] told Amnesty International his brother was made to speak about him at a flag-raising ceremony. “[My brother] had to confess that his brother had ‘disease’ and that he was ashamed and sorry,” he said. [[[39]]]</p>
<h3 id="government-minders">Government minders</h3>
<p>As discussed in Chapter&nbsp;X, one of the most invasive aspects of life in Xinjiang for ex-detainees is the presence of government minders. Many survivors reported that after they were released from a camp, government cadres were required to stay with them in their houses for several nights per month. [[[SRVIVORS WITH GOVERNMENT MINDERS: G1, J2 (worked for gov), E2, f2, x2,b2, b2, 15, q2 + ADD]]] Survivors reported that while they were in the camp, their family members were required to have minders stay with them. [[[11, 27]]]</p>
<h3 id="restrictions-on-camp-survivors-freedom-of-movement-inside-china">Restrictions on camp survivors’ freedom of movement inside China</h3>
<p>All survivors faced significant restrictions on their freedom of movement after they were released from the camp. Nearly all were prohibited from leaving their village or township. If they were allowed to leave they were required to get written permission from the authorities beforehand. [[[O2, 43]]] Some survivors were put under additional detention in the form of house arrest for several months. Many were required to check in with the police or village administrators daily. A few survivors were forced to live at the village administration office or police station for a few week or months. [[[I2]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym D1] told Amnesty how his movements were restricted after he was released: “I spent five months being monitored. I just stayed in the village. I couldn’t leave without permission. I had to report to the village [administration] office each morning. I needed permission to leave the village from the village chief,” he said. [[[D1]]]</p>
<p>Many survivors reported that for months after they left the camp their ID cards were programmed such that an alarm would sound whenever they travelled through the ever-present checkpoints or whenever they left their village. [[[Q1, Y2, B2]]] After IDs triggered an alarm ex-internees were often interrogated about the very same things they were questioned about after their arrest and during their detention. [[[B2]]] [Pseudonym X11], a woman in her fifties who had been detained for a year for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty International how her movement was restricted after she was released from the camp:</p>
<p><strong>“After I was released… it was house arrest. Every time I scanned my ID it went off… I wasn’t allowed to go to another town. Even in the streets, the camp follows you… Even when I went to buy a meal I had to fill in a form saying I had been to a camp. It was shameful… my daughter was living [in another town], I couldn’t visit her because of this. Can you imagine going into the street and the police surrounding you every time?”</strong> [[[cite]]]</p>
<p>Other survivors told Amnesty their ID was confiscated for a time after their release. “[When I wasn’t in class or at a flag-raising ceremony] I had to stay at home the rest of the time, because the inspector could come at any time. I had to be found in one of these places at all times. My ID was taken. I wasn’t free,” [Pseudonym M1] told Amnesty. [[[M1]]]</p>
<p>After several months some of the movement restrictions began to decrease. Many survivors reported that some restrictions were lifted after six months. [[[RESTRICTIONS LIFTED AFTER SIX MONTHS: I2, A2, X1. K1, p1 + ADD]]] Others told Amnesty the restrictions on their movements lasted a year. [[[A3]]] One survivor told Amnesty the restrictions on his movements were removed at the same time as those of others released when he was. [[[F1]]]</p>
<p>Family members of camp survivors also had severe restrictions placed on their movement while their family member was in a camp. Survivors reported that their family members needed to get permission from local officials to leave their village. [[[P1; q2 – check both]]]</p>
<h3 id="restrictions-on-camp-survivors-freedom-of-movement-to-leave-the-country">Restrictions on camp survivors’ freedom of movement to leave the country</h3>
<p>It has been difficult for minorities in Xinjiang to travel abroad for years. [[[https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/07/13/one-passport-two-systems/chinas-restrictions-foreign-travel-tibetans-and-others]]] The restrictions became more severe in 2015 and 2016, when ethnic minorities were required to hand in their passports to authorities (see Chapter 2 above). [[[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/world/asia/passports-confiscated-XUAR-china-uighur.html; https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/22/china-passports-arbitrarily-recalled-XUAR]]] Since 2017, it has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs to leave China (see Chapter X). [[[cite]]] The Uyghurs who have gotten out have ties to foreign countries and have left after international pressure on China or after paying bribes [[[Insert cases here, H1 (Kyrgyz, early on)]]] (see Chapter&nbsp;4).</p>
<p>Kazakhs’ movements have also been restricted; however, after the intervention of the government of Kazakhstan, some Kazakhs with Kazakhstan citizenship or strong family ties to Kazakhstan have been able to leave China. Before leaving, people must go through a labyrinthine bureaucratic process to get their passports back and to secure permission to go abroad. [[[10]]] Ex-detainees face a further round of interrogations by security personnel and must sign additional documents stating they will not say anything about being in a camp, or their family members will be sent to a camp.</p>
<p>A few detainees were forced to give video testimonies before leaving the country. [Pseudonym 10], who spent several months trying to secure permission to travel to Kazakhstan, told Amnesty International he was forced to make a video extolling the benefits of the education he received in the camp before he was allowed to leave.</p>
<p><strong>“One week [after I got my passport back], people from the police called me again. Then they took my passport again and said they would keep it until a county-level official signed [the form]. And then they gave me a piece of paper to sign saying I would not disclose anything about the camp or the secrets of the People’s Republic of China, and I signed it. I made an oath that I would not disclose… After I signed, three or four cadres came to my house. They came with cameras. Before they started filming me they told me what to say – that I went to school and that I got knowledge and that I was happy with the government and with the opportunity to gain knowledge… In front of the camera I said that the Party was taking good care of me and that the government was helping the poor people… and that during the seven or eight months of my schooling the teacher and others were friendly and that they taught me well… I was instructed to say this so I said it. They saved the tape. They repeated to me not to say anything bad. Then I signed the paper where I said I would. Then they gave me my passport back. [Then I left the country].”</strong> [[[10]]]</p>
<p>[Pseudonym 13] told Amnesty International he was interrogated several times while trying to get passports for his family to go to Kazakhstan. Security officials told him repeatedly that he could not talk about what happened in the camps and that he had to swear on video that he would never disclose anything about the situation. His parents were also required to sign guarantor letters. “My parents had to say, ‘I do give my consent and I will be taken to a camp if my son ever speaks to foreign media and discloses what happened in camp’,” [[[13]]] he told Amnesty. Several months later his family was given their passports.</p>
<p>Many camp survivors told Amnesty that regaining their freedom of movement – to travel abroad and, in some cases, to travel within China outside of their home village – was contingent upon having one or more guarantors who agreed in writing that they themselves would be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing spoke or shared information about the internment camp system. [[[13,]]] One older woman needed many guarantors to leave. [[[15]]]</p>
<h3 id="survivors-abroad-harassed-families-punished">Survivors abroad harassed, families punished</h3>
<p>Survivors who managed to go aboard were often threatened if they did not return on time. [[[35]]] [Pseudonym 27] told Amnesty she was continually harassed by officials after she arrived in Kazakhstan. “Once I came to Kazakhstan, I thought I was free… But [government officials] kept calling. I realized that they would never let me live in peace,” she said. [[[27]]] Survivors told Amnesty they believe their family members were sent to camps because they left the country. [[[14 + ADD]]]</p>
<p>Survivors reported that government officials called them and threatened to send their family members to camps if they did not return or if they spoke out. [Pseudonym 46] told Amnesty that when he left Xinjiang he was told he would be sent to a camp if he did not return on time. When he did not return promptly, police called him and said they would take his father and father-in-law to a camp if he did not return. [[[46]]]</p>
<p>Survivors abroad were called by family members in Xinjiang – who were in the presence of government officials – asking them to return and saying that if they did not, the family member would be sent to a camp. [Pseudonym 1] told Amnesty that police called him with his son, and his son said he was going to be detained if the man did not return. [[[1]]] Since that phone call [Pseudonym 1] has been unable to speak with his family. “I have no idea where my children are. I have no information,” he said. </p>
<h1 id="crimes-against-humanity">7. Crimes Against Humanity </h1>
<p>Evidence collected by Amnesty International provides the factual basis for the conclusion that the government of China has committed crimes against humanity in the Xinjiang, including the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture, and persecution. [[[OTHERS WHO HAVE MADE CAH CONCLUSION: Essex chambers (https://14ee1ae3-14ee-4012-91cf-a6a3b7dc3d8b.usrfiles.com/ugd/14ee1a_3f31c56ca64a461592ffc2690c9bb737.pdf); HRW (https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2021/04/china0421_web_2.pdf); the economist (https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/13/genocide-is-the-wrong-word-for-the-horrors-of-xinjiang)]]] This evidence also demonstrates that the government has committed other serious violations of human rights, including the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion and belief; to participate in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination. These crimes have been directed against members of the region’s predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups, including ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, and Tajiks.</p>
<p>The survivor testimonies Amnesty International has gathered form the basis of these conclusions; these testimonies are corroborated by leaked Chinese government documents and other credible testimonial, photographic, and documentary evidence collected by journalists, scholars and investigators. Taken together, this evidence clearly illustrates that serious violations documented in this report follow a consistent pattern of criminal conduct and are part of well-documented government policy that is knowingly and purposefully being carried out on a massive scale by government officials all over Xinjiang. As a result, an independent, impartial, prompt, and effective investigation is needed to determine a comprehensive picture of the violations and to establish individual criminal responsibility for these crimes.</p>

<h3 id="crimes-against-humanity-in-international-law">Crimes against humanity in international law</h3>
<p>Crimes against humanity are offenses -- criminal acts, or other serious human rights violations or abuses -- committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population pursuant to, or in furtherance of, a state or organizational policy. [[[For an overview of the objective elements of Crimes against humanity see Cassese’s international criminal law; and International Criminal Court The Elements of Crimes ISBN No. 92-9227-232-2 accessible at https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/336923D8-A6AD-40EC-AD7B-45BF9DE73D56/0/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf.]]] Crimes against humanity are amongst the most serious crimes. They are prohibited during war or peace.</p>
<p>The Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC), contains articles that define crimes against humanity in a manner widely accepted as generally reflective of customary international law. [[[For an overview of the development of Crimes against humanity as customary international law see Cassese’s international criminal law, p. 84-92 maybe explain what customary international law is…]]] Article&nbsp;7(1) of the Statute enumerates 11 crimes against humanity, including imprisonment, torture, and persecution. [[[Rome Statute, Articles 7(1)(a) – (k),: “(a) Murder; (b) Extermination; (c) Enslavement; (d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population; (e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; (f) Torture; (g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; (h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectively on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; (i) Enforced disappearance of persons; (j) The crime of apartheid; (k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.” It should be noted that other international criminal tribunals have used slightly different categorizations and lists of crimes under their jurisdiction, but the Rome Statute is now seen as an authoritative codification of existing international criminal law.]]] These crimes against humanity constitute crimes under international law, and as such are criminal wherever they are committed, whether or not they are criminal under domestic law or whether or not the state concerned has ratified the Rome Statute. [[[53 For a description of customary international law on crimes against humanity, see Report of the International Law Commission: Sixty seventh session (4 May-5 June and 6 July-7 August 2015), Chapter 7: Crimes against Humanity, UN Doc. A/70/10, p. 54 (“The characterization of crimes against humanity as ‘crimes under international law’ indicates that they exist as crimes whether or not the conduct has been criminalized under national law.”).]]]</p>
<p>There are four legal requirements common to all crimes against humanity: (1) the underlying offence must be committed as part of a “widespread or systematic attack”, (2) the attack must be “directed against the civilian population” [[[The term “population”, in the definition of crimes against humanity, has been interpreted to imply the “collective nature of the crime as an attack upon multiple victims”. See Situation in the Republic of Kenya, Decision, 31 March 2010 (footnote 44 above), para. 82; Bemba, Decision, 15 June 2009 (footnote 44 above), para. 77; Kunarac, Judgment, 22 February 2001 (footnote 45 above), para. 424; Tadić, Opinion and Judgment, 7 May 1997 (footnote 40 above), para.644. See Prosecutor v. Ante Gotovina, Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač, Case No. IT-06-90-T, Judgment, vol.II, 15 April 2011, Trial Chamber I, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, para.1704), where the court held that “population” means that “enough individuals were targeted in the course of the attack, or that they were targeted in such a way” as to make it clear that the victims were more than just “a limited and randomly selected number of individuals” have been targeted but that this does not require an attack against the “entire population” or all members of the population.]]], (3) the underlying offence must be carried out with the knowledge of the attack, and (4) the attack must be carried out as part of state or organization policy. These four general requirements establish the context in which specific prohibited acts must take place for them to be considered crimes against humanity. In addition, each specific crime against humanity requires proof of additional elements related to the specific underlying offence.  [[[https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/336923D8-A6AD-40EC-AD7B-45BF9DE73D56/0/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf]]]</p>
<p>An attack does not need to be both widespread and systematic; an attack that is either widespread or systematic will suffice. International criminal caselaw has helped to define what is required for an attack to be considered widespread or systematic. While one factor involved in determining whether an attack is widespread is the number of victims or magnitude of the acts, [[[See Prosecutor v. Akayesu, ICTR Trial Chamber, 2 September 1998, para. 579; Kordic and Cerkez, ICTY Trial Chamber, 26 February 2001, para. 179; Kayishema and Ruzindana, ICTR Trial Chamber, 21 May 1999, para. 123.]]] the term can also have a geographical dimension. [[[Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2019, paras 12 and 13. Supplement No. 10 (A/74/10); The ICC has held that an assessment of the quantitative and geographic facts will depend on the facts of each case: Situation in the Republic of Kenya, Case No. ICC-01/09, Decision pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the authorization of an investigation into the situation in the Republic of Kenya, 31 March 2010, Pre-Trial Chamber II, International Criminal Court, para. 95. See also Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Case No. ICC-01/05-01/08, Judgment pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, 21 March 2016, Trial Chamber III, International Criminal Court, para. 163.]]] Systematic means that the crimes and other prohibited acts have been committed in an organised manner and it is unlikely that they are merely random events. [[[Prosecutor v. Kunarac et al., ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgment, 22 February 2001, para. 429. See also Prosecutor v. Blaškic, ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgment, 3 March 2000, para. 203; and Prosecutor v. Akayesu, ICTR Trial Chamber, Judgment, 2 September 1998, para. 580.]]] International courts have commonly held that the systematic threshold is met when there are “[p]atterns of crimes – that is the nonaccidental repetition of similar criminal conduct on a regular basis.” [[[Prosecutor v. Kunarac et al., ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgment, 22 February 2001, para. 429. See also Prosecutor v. Tadic, ICTY Trial Chamber, Opinion and Judgment, 7 May 1997, para. 648.]]]</p>
<p>“Attack directed against any civilian population” is defined in Article&nbsp;7(2)(a) of the Rome Statute as “a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in [Article&nbsp;7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy to commit such attack.” [[[Rome Statute, Article 7(2)(a)]]]</p>
<p>It is rare for governments to express a policy to direct an attack at the civilian population. Thus the policy element is generally implied from the organised nature of the attack [[[THE PROSECUTOR V. LAURENT GBAGBO, Confirmation of Charges ICC-02/11-01/11-656-Red 12 June 2014, para. 216. Indeed the court held (para 215) that, “an attack which is planned, directed or organised – as opposed to spontaneous or isolated acts of violence – will satisfy the policy criterion, and there is no requirement that the policy be formally adopted.” The court noted that,” … evidence of planning, organisation or direction by a State or organisation may be relevant to prove both the policy and the systematic nature of the attack, although the two concepts should not be conflated.”]]], especially where the crimes consist of “repeated actions occurring according to a same sequence, or (follow)… preparations or collective mobilisation orchestrated and coordinated by that State or organisation.” [[[Katanga TJ, Katanga TJ, ICC-02/11-01/11-534 para. 1109]]]</p>
<p>Individuals are criminally responsible for crimes against humanity when they commit <em>any</em> of the underlying offenses, as long as they have a degree of knowledge about the contextual elements of the crime. Notably, perpetrators must have known that their actions were part of a widespread or systematic attack. [[[Rome Statute, Article 7(1). See also Prosecutor v. Kupreskic et al., ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgment, 14 January 2000, para. 556 (“[T]he requisite mens rea for crimes against humanity appears to be comprised by (1) the intent to commit the underlying offence, combined with (2) knowledge of the broader context in which that offence occurs.”). See also Prosecutor v. Tadic, ICTY Appeals Chamber, para. 271; Prosecutor v. Kayishema et al., ICTR Trial Chamber, Judgment, 21 May 1999, paras 133-34]]] However, an individual does not need to be personally responsible for the actual widespread or systematic attack to be found guilty; a single act can be sufficient if and only if it is carried out in the context of a broader attack of which the perpetrator was aware. [[[See cassess international criminal law]]]</p>
<p>Individuals, whether civilians or military, can be held criminally responsible for crimes against humanity under a number of modes of liability, including committing, co-perpetration, indirect perpetration, planning, ordering, aiding and abetting, as well as command responsibility. For all modes of responsibility for crimes under international law, superior orders cannot be invoked as a defence, [[[See, for example, Rome Statute, Article 33.]]] Command responsibility is a mode of individual criminal responsibility under treat and customary international law by which any superior, military commander or civilian, can be held responsible for the acts of his or her subordinates if he or she knew or should have known of the crimes and failed to prevent or stop. [[[Command responsibility is part of customary international law and conventional international law, and has been included as a mode of responsibility both in ad hoc tribunals and in the ICC. See, for example, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Article 7(3); Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Article 6(3); and Rome Statute, Article 28. For the ICRC’s iteration of command responsibility as defined in customary international law, see The International Committee of the Red Cross (JeanMarie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, eds), Customary International Humanitarian Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), Rule 153, pp. 558-563. The ICRC definition applies to responsibility for war crimes rather than crimes against humanity, but the rule is very similar, if not identical, in the two cases. Thus the provisions for command responsibility in the Statutes of the International Tribunals for Rwanda and for former Yugoslavia cover both types of crimes. For additional information, see Amnesty International, The International Criminal Court: Checklist for effective implementation (Index: IOR 40/11/00), July 2000; and G. Mettraux, The Law of Command Responsibility (2009), p. 21.]]]</p>
<p>Under international law, states may, and in some cases must, exercise universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. [[[Amnesty International, Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and enforce legislation (Index: IOR 53/008/2001), 1 September 2001, Chapter 5.]]] Any state may, under customary international law, undertake one of the following actions against suspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity, even if the suspects are neither nationals nor residents of the state concerned, and even if the crime(s) did not take place under its jurisdiction or in its territory: bring such persons before its own courts, extradite such persons to any state willing to do so, or surrender such persons to an international criminal court with jurisdiction to try persons for these crimes. Regarding torture and enforced disappearances exercising universal jurisdiction over suspected perpetrators is a legal obligation, not a choice. [[[See, for example, UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Articles 5-9. As of March 2021, 170 states are party to this Convention, including China; See also CTM, section 6.4]]]</p>

<h2 id="evidence-of-the-crimes-against-humanity-of-imprisonment-torture-and-persecution">7.1 Evidence of the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture, and persecution</h2>
<p>According to the evidence Amnesty International has gathered, corroborated by other sources, members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been subjected to an attack meeting all the contextual elements of crimes against humanity under international law:</p>
<p>The widespread nature of the attack is evident both because massive numbers of members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang have been imprisoned, tortured, or persecuted and because these violations have occurred throughout the geographical area of Xinjiang. The violations appear to have been systematic since the victims have been subjected to the same or comparable forms of persecution, deprivation of liberty, conditions of detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and harassment and surveillance on release regardless of where they were seized and where they were detained. All were detained in various camps administered by the government throughout the region, making it inconceivable that these violations are random occurrences.</p>
<p>The same evidence also demonstrates that these violations were organized, planned, and committed consequent to a state policy to direct an attack against a civilian population – in this case members of predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups -- and to use violence, arbitrary and unlawful imprisonment, and intimidation to achieve the government’s aims to ostensibly eradicate “terrorism”, “extremism”, and “separatism” but which, in effect, is used to target Islamic religious practices and beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices. These acts have been targeted exclusively at members of predominantly Muslim minority ethnic groups and effectively all members of these groups are vulnerable to imprisonment and ill-treatment, demonstrating that the attack has been directed at a civilian population.</p>
<p>The evidence we have seen therefore demonstrates that the perpetrators, acting on behalf of the Chinese state, have carried out a widespread as well as systematic attack, consisting of a planned, massive, organized, and systematic pattern of serious violations directed at the civilian population in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Amnesty International believes there are strong grounds to suspect that at least the following crimes against humanity have been committed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty</strong> [[[7(1)(e) - https://asp.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Publications/Compendium/ElementsOfCrime-ENG.pdf]]] The XX camp survivors interviewed for this report provided accounts of their arbitrary detention as well as the arbitrary detention of other people detained with them in internment camps throughout Xinjiang. Evidence gathered by journalists and other investigations suggests massive numbers – estimated to be 1 million or more – of men and women have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps or prisons throughout Xinjiang since 2017.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Torture means</strong> [[[Unlike torture as defined in Article&nbsp;1 of the UNCAT, there is no purposive requirement that the ill-treatment be committed for a specific purpose, or a requirement that the ill-treatment be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In addition, the Rome Statute does not explicitly differentiate between torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as the UNCAT does. Nevertheless, the ICC has held that a conviction of the crime against humanity of torture will require “an important degree of pain and suffering” , implying that the threshold under the UNCAT may apply (see: Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute ICC-01/05-01/08 15 June 2009 para 193) . However, the ICC has also held that it will not judge the severity of each incident of ill-treatment; instead, it will consider the cumulative effect of a course of conduct. (Prosecutor v. Krnojelac, ICTY Trial Chamber II, Judgement, IT-97-25-T, 15 March, paras. 182-183. See also, Prosecutor v. Brđanin, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Judgement, IT-99-36-A, 3 April 2007, para. 251, citing Prosecutor v. Naletilić and Martinović, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Judgement, IT-98-34-A, 3 May 2006, para. 299; Prosecutor v. Delalić et al., ICTY Trial Chamber, Judgement, IT-96-21-T, 16 November 1998 (“Delalić Trial Judgement”), para. 467; Ireland v. United Kingdom, Case no. 5310/71, Judgment, 18 January 1978, para. 162.)]]] <strong>“</strong>the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions” [[[See 7(1)(f) - https://asp.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Publications/Compendium/ElementsOfCrime-ENG.pdf; Also]]] The XX camp survivors interviewed for this report provided accounts of the torture and other ill-treatment that they experienced inside the internment camps, as well of the of the torture and other ill-treatment that they witnessed being done to other detainees in their camps. This includes the physical torture of a significant portion of the internment camp population by prolonged and severe beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), the physical consequences of sleep deprivation, and solitary confinement. This also includes the physical and mental ill-treatment of all internment camp detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps, which may also amount to torture as defined under international criminal law. This treatment includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including and exacerbated by not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native language while in detention, living under constant threat of violence and other abuse, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. This testimonial evidence is broadly consistent with other first and second-hand accounts of torture and other ill-treatment documented by journalists and other human rights organizations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persecution</strong>, which means “the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity”. [[[7(1)(h)]]] The evidenced gathered by Amnesty strongly indicates that such persecution has occurred, including through the ethnically targeted campaign of mass arbitrary detention and torture documented in Chapters X and X, as well as other ethnically-targeted restrictions on human rights including to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to the freedoms of movement, opinion, expression, thought, conscience, religion and belief; to take part in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination, documented in Chapter X.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evidence-of-other-crimes-against-humanity">Evidence of other crimes against humanity</h3>
<p>There is further strong evidence from numerous sources that other crimes against humanity <em><strong>may</strong></em> have also been committed. Considering the extreme restrictions on accessing Xinjiang and the difficulties faced in documenting violations committed in the region, Amnesty International believes further investigation into these allegation of other crimes against humanity must also be prioritized.</p>
<p>Including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enforced disappearances [[[Amnesty International considers that the prohibition of enforced disappearance is a peremptory norm of general international law (jus cogens).Every instance of secret detention, which places people outside the protection of the law, facilitating torture and other human rights violations and is itself prohibited under international law, amounts to an enforced disappearance. Detention without access to the outside world (incommuicado detention) equally facilitates torture and other ill-treatment and enforced disappearance and can itself amount to such practices Enforced disappearance is absolutely prohibited as a crime under international law. When committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population, enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity (Article 5 of the Convention on Enforced Disappearance).]]], which means “ the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.” [[[https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf]]] Evidence collected by Amnesty for this report shows that in most present cases, detainees’ family members were aware of their detention and were able to communicate with them, although this was often very infrequent and always monitored communications; however, in a small number of cases survivors were detained for months or years without their families having any information about the detained persons’ fate. In 2018, Amnesty International spoke with more than 100 people outside of China who said they had lost touch with and were unable to reach or obtain information about relatives and friends inside Xinjiang and feared that they had been detained. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA1791132018ENGLISH.PDF]]] Journalists have also reported on family members who are unable to obtain information about family members they suspect have been detained. [[[Austin Ramzy, “‘Show Me That My Father is Alive.’ China Faces Torrent of Online Pleas,” New York Times, February 17, 2019, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/world/asia/uighurs-china-internment-camps.html; alse see Letter from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (2018); 0 Joint Statement (2019) 9.]]]</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It is part of the extensive cover-up by the authorities that the whereabouts of many of the people sent to internment camps is not known. The secretive and undocumented way people are detained makes it nearly impossible for people outside of China to trace or confirm the whereabouts of any particular individual. Especially persons from Xinjiang who are now abroad often have no way to establish the whereabouts of their missing family members. [[[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/02/china-uyghurs-abroad-living-in-fear/]]] Even if the families believe that their relatives may have been sent to an internment camp , they never receive any official information from the Chinese authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The crime of apartheid</strong>, which means “inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.” Given the evidence of widespread and systematic discrimination documented in this report, along with the significant evidence of discrimination documented by journalists and other investigators, it is plausible that this regime of discrimination is designed to ensure the oppression and domination of Muslim religious, ethnic or racial groups and therefore may amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid. [[[The term “apartheid” was used by the South African state to define policies of racial segregation and discrimination implemented between 1948 and 1994. International efforts to condemn the system and similar practices in southern Africa during this period adopted the term. As a result, apartheid is expressly prohibited in international human rights law including in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination). The prohibition forms part of customary international law, and it is considered to be an absolute norm of general international law (jus&nbsp;cogens), as well as part of the obligation all states have towards the international community as a whole, to protect against racial discrimination (erga omnes). The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of 1973 (Apartheid Convention), defines apartheid as a crime against humanity and obliges states parties to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of criminal responsibility for the crime. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1998 also defines apartheid as a crime against humanity. Article 7(2)(h) of the Rome Statute provides that the crime against humanity of apartheid is committed when prohibited acts are committed “in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”.]]] Further research is needed to determine whether the regime meets the definition of the human rights violation and crime against humanity of apartheid; however, there is sufficient evidence for an independent investigation to consider whether the crime against humanity of apartheid has been committed.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence gathered by journalists, scholar, and other investigators have also provided evidence of three other crimes against humanity: ‘<strong>Enslavement</strong>’ [[["Enslavement" means the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children;EVIDENCE OF ENSLAVEMENT FROM OTHER SOURCES:]]]; ‘<strong>Deportation or forcible transfer of population</strong>’ [[["Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the persons concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law;EVIDENCE OF POPULATION TRANSFER FROM OTHER SOURCES:]]]; and ‘<strong>Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity</strong>’ [[[EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE FROM OTHER SOURCES:]]].</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evidence-of-other-serious-violations-of-international-human-rights-law">7.2 Evidence of other serious violations of international human rights law</h2>
<p>Evidence gathered from survivors and other witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International demonstrates that the authorities have committed other serious violations of human rights in addition to those underlying the crimes against humanity described above; these include grave violations of the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion and belief; to take part in cultural life; and to equality and non-discrimination.</p>
<p>In particular, the evidence collected for the report provides evidence of violations of the human rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>To freedom of religion and the right to take part in cultural life:</strong> The instances of restrictions on religious and cultural practice documented in Chapter X and X are clear violations of freedom of religion and the right to take part in cultural life. This includes the fact that as part of the apparent campaign to “root out” Islamic religious practices and culturally assimilate Muslims in Xinjiang, numerous such practices that Muslims widely consider essential parts of their religion, such as praying and carrying out traditional rituals and ceremonies but that are not explicitly prohibited by law in Xinjiang, are now, in effect, prohibited and are grounds for being sent to an internment camp. Many survivors explained that they effectively stopped displaying any signs of being religious due to fear of detention or other punishment. The prohibition on possessing religious or cultural artifacts and the destruction of religious and cultural sites are also clear violations of the right to religion as well as the state’s duty to protect cultural property and heritage. That fact that languages other than Chinese have been banned in the internment camps and heavily restricted outside of the camps is a violation of the right of linguistic minorities to use their own language. Moreover, the entire internment camp system is designed in a way that it not only prevents Muslim detainees from being able to practice any aspect of their religion but also attempts to forcibly indoctrinate them against Islamic religious practice and belief.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>To freedom of movement:</strong> The instances of restrictions on freedom of movement documented in Chapters X and X of this report clearly go far beyond what could be considered necessary and proportionate for a recognized aim and lack any effective safeguards. Examples of disproportionate limitations to the right to freedom of movement include general requirements to obtain official permission before travelling either internally or abroad, the blanket confiscation of passports, and a state’s refusal to issue a passport or extend its validity based on unnecessary legal rules or administrative measures, and the ubiquitous system of checkpoints. An especially egregious violation of the freedom of movement is that travelling abroad, attempting to travel abroad, or associating with people abroad is grounds for being detained and sent to an internment camp. Limitations are particularly excessive for internment camp survivors, in many cases amounting to a form of detention.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>To liberty and security of person:</strong> The instances of arbitrary detention documented in this report are clearly violations of the right to liberty of person.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>To privacy</strong>: The instances documented in Chapters X and X clearly go far beyond what could be considered legitimate, necessary, and proportionate limitations, and they lack the adequate safeguards to be considered “provided by law”. Example of unlawful limitations include excessive and involuntary biometric data collection, and the massive collection and retention of this and other personal information; regular searches and interrogations by ubiquitous security officers without reasonable grounds or suspicion; “homestays” by government employees and cadres assigned to live with ethnic minority families; an ever-present network of indiscriminate mass surveillance cameras, including facial recognition cameras, and other extensive, invasive in-person and electronic monitoring ; random checks of private phones and other unfettered access to people’s personal communication devices, including their contacts and social media accounts; attempts to restrict all personal digital communication to apps and platforms that it can access and monitor, and that having unsanctioned software installed on a phone, or visiting a forbidden website is grounds for being detained and sent to an internment camp. [[[https://docs.uhrp.org/pdf/MassDetention_of_Uyghurs.pdf]]] .</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>To</strong> <strong>opinion and</strong> <strong>expression</strong>: The ceaseless forced political indoctrination, especially during camp internment but also afterwards, violates the right to hold opinions, which is absolute and not open to any qualifications such as on ground like national security. This is demonstrated in the punitive pushing [“teaching”?] of secular state-approved views and behaviours, the aim to ultimately transform members of Muslim ethnic minorities living in Xinjiang into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, and the various ways how former detainees are forbidden from talking about their experiences. The instances of restrictions on the right to freedom of expression in Chapter X clearly go beyond what is legitimate and proportionate.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>To equality and non-discrimination</strong>: Testimony provided to Amnesty by former residents of Xinjiang and other witnesses demonstrates that the government’s policy not only clearly discriminate against Muslim ethnic groups, but also that restrictions on the human rights to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, and religion; and to participate in cultural life are enforced in a discriminatory manner. The latter includes the facts that police only stopped ethnic minorities on the street or at checkpoints and checked their IDs, that Han Chinese either did not need to go through the checkpoints at all or were essentially waved through without having to have their bodies or phones searched and without being questioned, and much greater difficulties in being allowed to access public transport and commercial entities such as hotels and shops. The whole framework of treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups runs starkly counter to the state’s duties to take positive steps to address long-standing disadvantages and to eliminate, prevent and remedy discrimination, not only by its own officials but also by private individuals and other non-state actors.</p>

<li id="fn129" role="doc-endnote"><p>Face <em>identification</em> systems are used to identify individuals by their face, among a number of people, by comparing that face against a database of images to see if any matches are found. This kind of system is used by law enforcement to identify individuals against a watchlist. The individual is typically not involved in this process, which in particular does not require prior credentials to have been registered by them. In contrast, face <em>verification</em> systems (also described as face authentication systems) scan a face and attempt to match this face to a corresponding face image on a database of existing images. They are used, for example, to enter a building or pass through border control at an airport. The individual is typically involved in this process, including when a facial image is recorded at the time of registration.<a href="#fnref129" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

Between 2014 and 2017, XUAR authorities sent 200,000 cadres from government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and public institutions to be stationed in villages, regularly visit and surveil people, and subject them to political propaganda, a scheme that has been extended indefinitely.16 In October 2016, authorities initiated a related effort, called the “Becoming Family” (㔃ሩ䇔Ӣ) campaign. Since December 2017, this “Becoming Family” campaign has been expanded as a compulsory homestay programme where more than a million cadres spend at least five days every two months in the homes of XUAR residents primarily in the countryside.17 16 “200,000 Communist Party members Dispatched to Stay in Grassroots Villages in XUAR to Visit the People, Benefit the People, and Get Together the Hearts of the People (ᯠ⮶ 20 зᵪޣᒢ䜘лสቲտзᶁˈ䇯≁ᛵǃᜐ≁⭏ǃ㚊≁ᗳ),” People Online (Ӫ≁㖁, http://xj.people.com.cn/GB/188750/361873/ (accessed August 14, 2018). 17 “China: Visiting Officials Occupy Homes in Muslim Region,” Human Rights Watch news release, May 13, 2018, https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/13/china-visiting-officials-occupy-homes-muslim-region.<a href="#fnref141" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn667" role="doc-endnote"><p>Command responsibility is part of customary international law and conventional international law, and has been included as a mode of responsibility both in ad hoc tribunals and in the ICC. See, for example, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Article 7(3); Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Article 6(3); and Rome Statute, Article 28. For the ICRC’s iteration of command responsibility as defined in customary international law, see The International Committee of the Red Cross (JeanMarie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, eds), Customary International Humanitarian Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), Rule 153, pp. 558-563. The ICRC definition applies to responsibility for war crimes rather than crimes against humanity, but the rule is very similar, if not identical, in the two cases. Thus the provisions for command responsibility in the Statutes of the International Tribunals for Rwanda and for former Yugoslavia cover both types of crimes. For additional information, see Amnesty International, The International Criminal Court: Checklist for effective implementation (Index: IOR 40/11/00), July 2000; and G.

<li id="fn671" role="doc-endnote"><p>Unlike torture as defined in Article&nbsp;1 of the UNCAT, there is no purposive requirement that the ill-treatment be committed for a specific purpose, or a requirement that the ill-treatment be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In addition, the Rome Statute does not explicitly differentiate between torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as the UNCAT does. Nevertheless, the ICC has held that a conviction of the crime against humanity of torture will require “an important degree of pain and suffering” , implying that the threshold under the UNCAT may apply (see: <em>Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo</em> ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute ICC-01/05-01/08 15 June 2009 para 193) . However, the ICC has also held that it will not judge the severity of each incident of ill-treatment; instead, it will consider the cumulative effect of a course of conduct. (<em>Prosecutor v.

<li id="fn674" role="doc-endnote"><p>Amnesty International considers that the prohibition of enforced disappearance is a peremptory norm of general international law (<em>jus cogens</em>).Every instance of secret detention, which places people outside the protection of the law, facilitating torture and other human rights violations and is itself prohibited under international law, amounts to an enforced disappearance. Detention without access to the outside world (incommuicado detention) equally facilitates torture and other ill-treatment and enforced disappearance and can itself amount to such practices Enforced disappearance is absolutely prohibited as a crime under international law. When committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population, enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity (Article 5 of the Convention on Enforced Disappearance).<a href="#fnref674" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn679" role="doc-endnote"><p>The term “apartheid” was used by the South African state to define policies of racial segregation and discrimination implemented between 1948 and 1994. International efforts to condemn the system and similar practices in southern Africa during this period adopted the term. As a result, apartheid is expressly prohibited in international human rights law including in the <em>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</em>). The prohibition forms part of customary international law, and it is considered to be an absolute norm of general international law (<em>jus&nbsp;cogens</em>), as well as part of the obligation all states have towards the international community as a whole, to protect against racial discrimination (<em>erga omnes</em>). The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of 1973 (Apartheid Convention), defines apartheid as a crime against humanity and obliges states parties to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of criminal responsibility for the crime. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1998 also defines apartheid as a crime against humanity. Article 7(2)(h) of the Rome Statute provides that the crime against humanity of apartheid is committed when prohibited acts are committed “in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”.<a href="#fnref679" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

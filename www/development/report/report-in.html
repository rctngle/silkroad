<p>Cultural Erasure in Xinjiang: Mass internment, torture, and forced assimilation of Muslims in northwest China</p>
<h1 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim peoples living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and persecution. In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses against these peoples. An objective of the government’s campaign is to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>To achieve this political indoctrination and cultural erasure, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment and forced assimilation. More than a million men and women – Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, Tajiks, and Hui– have been arbitrarily detained in what the government refers to as “vocational training centres” or “transformation through education” centres, but which are more accurately described as internment camps. In these camps, detainees are subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.</p>
<p>The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour of ethnic minorities outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, peaceful assembly, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up it abuses in Xinjiang and, in particular, to prevent foreigners from obtaining information about the internment camps. The whereabouts of many of the people sent to internment camps is not known. Many remain in indefinite incommunicado detention in the camps. Hundreds of thousands have been transferred to situations of forced labour or given long prison sentences. Those who have been permitted to return to their homes do so under strict conditions limiting their movement and associations.</p>
<p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign – and the associated cover-up – derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic monitories is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert – along with a substantial portion of the civilian population who have been terrorized into complicity – to conduct the surveillance, enforce illegal policies, and administer the internment camps, prisons, and forced labour. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their basic human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.</p>
<p>This report details human rights violations committed by the Government of China in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2021. The findings are based primarily on first-hand testimonial evidence from XX survivors and witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International, XX of whom had never shared their stories publicly before. The report also draws on leaked government documents and a substantial body of public reporting by journalists and other investigators. Evidence demonstrates that the Government of China knowingly and purposefully targeted ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including by unlawful restriction of their basic human rights, as well as by an ethnically targeted campaign of mass detention, and torture and other ill treatment. The government’s actions evince a clear intent to target certain populations collectively on the basis of their ethnicity and religion and to use serious violence and intimidation to outlaw their religious practices and eradicate their ethno-cultural identify. On the basis of the evidence gathered by Amnesty International and from other sources that Amnesty has concluded to be credible, this report concludes that the Government of China has committed serious violations of international human rights law and international criminal law, including crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>The report has 12 chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 2 describes the research methodology and details the obstacles to conducting human rights research in Xinjiang.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 3 provides background information Xinjiang and gives an overview of the cycles of violence, discrimination, and repression that occurred in Xinjiang from the 1980s to 2016.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 4 describes major human rights violations in Xinjiang since 2017 that have occurred outside the camps, including the severe restrictions on freedom of religion, freedom of movement, and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 5 focuses on what happens to detainees from the time they are detained until they enter an internment camp: the process of arbitrary detention, interrogation, biometric data collection, and transfer to a camp.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 6 details life for detainees inside the internment camps, including the conditions in the camps, the highly regimented daily routines, and the content of the “re-education” curriculum. Chapter 6 also provides information about the structure and scale of the internment camp system and, using satellite imagery, provides estimates of the number, size, and location of operational camps.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 7 describes the widespread and systematic use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in the internment camps.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 8 examines the process that determines whether detainees are released from internment camps or sent to prisons or situations of forced labour.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 9 describes the restrictions on the rights and freedoms placed on ex-internees and their families after internees are released from the camps, including the surveillance by government minders, who often live with ex-detainees; other restrictions on movement and association; continued “re-education” classes; and social ostracization.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 10 argues that the abuses committed in Xinjiang since 2017 meet the all elements of the elements of crimes against humanity under international criminal law.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 11 concludes</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 12 provides recommendations to the Government of China and UN bodies and member states</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="methodology">2. Methodology</h1>
<p>This report is a product of field and remote research carried out between October 2019 and April 2021. The report’s findings and conclusions draw heavily from first-hand testimonies that Amnesty International gathered from survivors and witnesses, as well as an analysis of satellite imagery and data. The report also draws on testimonial evidence and confidential government documents gathered from journalists, diaspora groups, and other human rights organizations.</p>
<p>Between October 2019 and April 2021, Amnesty International interviewed XXX people with knowledge of the situation in Xinjiang, China: XX (XX men and XX women) were survivors of internment camps, XX had lived in or visited Xinjiang since 2017, X had worked in the internment camp system, XX were family members of detainees.</p>
<p>These testimonies represent a significant portion of all public testimonial evidence gathered about the situation in Xinjiang since 2017. According to the Shahit database – a website that aggregates and synthesizes all publicly available testimony related to the Xinjiang internment camps – excluding the survivors interviewed in this report, only XX camp survivors have ever spoken publicly.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> XX of the XX survivors and witnesses interviewed for this report had never shared their story publicly before, and XX had never shared a significant portion of their story.</p>
<p>Amnesty informed interviewees about the nature and purpose of the research and about how the information they provided would be used. Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee before the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in exchange for their accounts. Interviews generally lasted between four and 12 hours and were often conducted over the course of two days. The vast majority of interviews were conducted using translators fluent in Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz; a few were conducted in English. Interviews were conducted in person in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey and remotely in XX other countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Interviews with survivors and witnesses were conducted individually.</p>
<p>For reasons related to the security of the potential interviewees, no interviews were conducted in Xinjiang either in person or remotely. The Government of China threatens, detainees, tortures, and “disappears” individuals who speak publicly about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Many survivors and witnesses are rightly afraid of being identified as having spoken with Amnesty International. <em><strong>As a result, nearly all interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee’s name and/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee’s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases.</strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, since only a small number of internment camp survivors (likely a few hundred) are believed to have left China, and because the government likely knows the identify of each of them as well as details about their life and their time in the internment camps, Amnesty took a very conservative approach to including any information that could be identifying. For example, none of the testimony in this report is associated with a specific internment camp where an interviewee was detained or with a specific village or town where an interviewee lived, and only rarely with a specific age or occupation of the interviewee.</p>
<h2 id="obstacles-to-investigating-the-human-rights-situation-in-xinjiang">2.1 Obstacles to investigating the human rights situation in Xinjiang</h2>
<p>The Government of China has taken extraordinary measures to prevent accurate information about the situation in Xinjiang from being documented. Chinese citizens living in China – particularly internment camp survivors – have been effectively prevented from speaking or otherwise sharing information about the situation in Xinjiang. The possibility of speaking from Xinjiang over a genuinely secure form of communication is remote and the consequences of being identified are severe. All members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are under heavy surveillance (see Chapter X). Anyone living in Xinjiang who does speak out about the internment camps, is perceived to have spoken out, or is accused of speaking out risks arrest, detention, imprisonment, torture, and disappearance, not only for themselves but also for their family members.</p>
<p>The risks are even more severe for ex-detainees and their families, who already face heightened levels of suspicion and surveillance. For at least several months after being released from a camp, all ex-internees are under near constant electronic and in-person surveillance (see Chapter X). Every internment camp survivor who spoke with Amnesty signed a document that forbid them from speaking with anybody – especially journalists and foreigners – about what they experienced in the camp. The document reportedly specifies that if they violate this prohibition they will be interned again, along with members of their family (see Chapter X).</p>
<p>As a result of the obstacles and risks facing people in Xinjiang, with few exceptions the vast majority of credible testimonial evidence about the situation has been gathered from survivors and witnesses who have left Xinjiang and spoken from abroad. Speaking from abroad is also difficult and comes with serious risks, especially for family members of the person speaking who remain in China. Since at least 2017, obtaining permission to travel abroad – and, in many cases, domestically – has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs, and extraordinarily difficult for other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Members of ethnic minority groups who have obtained permission to travel abroad since 2017 appear to require a connection to a foreign country (usually citizenship or immediate family) and one or more “guarantors” in Xinjiang who agree, in writing, that they will be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing speaks or shares information about the internment camps or does not return to China on time. As documented in this report and elsewhere, these are not empty threats: family members of people who speak about the issue from abroad have been sent to internment camps and in some cases disappeared (see Chapter X).</p>
<p>Independent journalists and human rights investigators have all been denied unfettered access to the region. A few have entered disguised as tourists but have found it nearly impossible to speak safely with people about the internment camps.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Those who have travelled to the region officially have encountered a coordinated effort by government officials to block them from speaking with survivors and witnesses and from accessing internment camps, except in situations where the government tries to exercise complete control over where they visit, who they speak with, and what is said to them.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Reporting about the situation from abroad also carries significant risk. In several instances, when journalists with family in Xinjiang have reported on or spoken about the situation in Xinjiang from abroad, family members have been arrested, sent to a camp or prison, or disappeared.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Chinese government officials have also made a concerted effort to disseminate misinformation and disinformation, both to foreigners and to the local population, about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Several internment camp survivors told Amnesty International that they were forced to give false statements to their families or to the media, both while interned and after they had been released.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Several survivors told Amnesty that while they were detained they had been coached about what to say to foreign journalists or Chinese government delegations that visited their camp.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> [Pseudonym Q1], told Amnesty how he was trained to speak with journalists who were expected to come to the camp he was in:</p>
<p><strong>“One day they told us journalists were coming. And that when you see them to smile. And to say what you were told or you will be taken to an underground room [where people are tortured] … [During the days before the journalists were scheduled to arrive] our Chinese language classes stopped. And we practised answering questions for journalists, for more than 10 days… we practised saying that the food is good and the Chinese Communist Party is great. I don’t know if the journalists ever came because we were not allowed to go out. I heard they came, but I didn’t see them.”</strong><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X2], who spent more than a year in multiple internment camps, told Amnesty that she was part of group that was coached for 20 days about what to say to visiting journalists. “[We were coached] to say that we are studying well, deepening our knowledge, and we are thankful to the state, are getting a salary, that our family is taken care of, that we are here for the daytime only, and here voluntarily,” she said.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> None of this was true.</p>
<p>In 2019, leaked government documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), <em>The New York Times</em>, and other media outlets and scholars appear to have triggered attempts to put even tighter controls on information coming out of Xinjiang, including through the physical destruction of documents related to the internment camp system.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Amnesty International received several account of government cadres being made to burn files related to the internment camp system in the aftermath of the leaks.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> One camp survivor – a former government cadre – told Amnesty that he participated in burning files. “I attended the burning. It was in… 2019, after I was released… I was helping to carry the files…It was not only the [detainees’] files. It is any re-education related materials. For example, all notes from meetings… it took five or six days to burn everything [in the office],” he said.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The government’s attempts to silence the affected population and destroy the evidence echo a directive from one of the leaked government documents – known as the “Telegram” – obtained by the ICIJ, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining “strict secrecy” with respect to everything that happens inside camps.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> While the leaked portion of the directive lacks significant details about how the secrecy will be maintained beyond the statement that “[i]t is necessary to strengthen the [internment camps’] staff’s awareness of staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline,” the experiences of survivors and witnesses documented in this report and elsewhere illustrate the immense resources that have been devoted to this cover-up effort, as well as the often violent methods used ensure the silence of the civilian population.</p>
<h1 id="background">3. Background</h1>
<p>The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is in the far northwest of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). A huge area – 1.66 million km<sup>2</sup> – it encompasses approximately one-sixth of China’s landmass and is bordered by eight countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Afghanistan.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The area comprises vast semi-desert steppes in the north and severe desert basins ringed by historic oasis towns in the south.</p>
<p>The XUAR is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. According to China’s 2010 census the region had a population of approximately 22 million. More than half of the region’s population belongs to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million), Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and other populations whose languages, cultures, and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han, who are the majority in “interior” China.</p>
<p>The area covered by the XUAR was renowned over centuries for the ancient Silk Road and its flourishing conduit of trade and culture between China and the rest of the world. Rich in coal, natural gas, and oil, the XUAR is intertwined with many of China’s economic, strategic, and foreign policy goals. China’s leaders now consider stability in the XUAR vital to the success of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, a massive global infrastructure development programme aimed at strengthening China’s links to Central Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>The XUAR is one of the five autonomous regions of the PRC, where the officially recognized “national minorities” are granted some formal representation in the organs of regional government. The autonomy conferred to these regions by the PRC Constitution and Law on Regional Autonomy has remained largely symbolic. In the XUAR, as in the rest of the PRC, all major policy decisions are taken by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p>The Government of China considers the XUAR to have been an inseparable part of China for millennia. But this history is disputed by many, particularly Uyghurs, who often perceive China as a colonizing force and aspire to independence. Aspirations towards independence have their roots in both the distant past and recent history. During the 1930s and 1940s, two independent Republics of Eastern Turkestan were formed successively in Kashgar (1933) and Ili (1944) as attempts to resist Chinese rule.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Both republics were short-lived, but they have continued to inspire nationalist opposition since 1949, particularly among Uyghurs. Over the years, various opposition groups militating for Eastern Turkestan’s independence were formed clandestinely in the XUAR. Some of these groups have resorted to violence (see below).</p>
<p>The region has been an important target for population resettlement from interior China since 1949. In 1949, the local Turkic population, in majority Uyghur, accounted for at least 93% of the region’s population, while ethnic Chinese in the region amounted to about 6 or 7% of the population. According to official statistics, Han Chinese now make up approximately 40% of the population. With the massive influx of Han Chinese, the indigenous population has felt increasingly marginalized in what they regard as their ancestral land.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>During the first three decades of the PRC, resettlement of Han Chinese into the XUAR was facilitated by what is now called the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (commonly known as the Bingtuan), an institution established in the early 1950s. The Bingtuan, described by many scholars as an institution that served to colonize Xinjiang, is both an administrative organ with a somewhat military structure and a large development corporation. It is established along the border and in pockets of territory roughly across the centre of the XUAR, separating the north, where most Kazakhs in Xinjiang live, from the mainly Uyghur south. The Bingtuan has jurisdiction over several million hectares of land and the vast majority of the population in this area is ethnic Han Chinese. It is a unique institution in the PRC and enjoys special status. It is administered independently from the XUAR regional government and has its own police force, courts, and agricultural and industrial enterprises, as well as its own large network of labour camps and prisons.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cycles-of-discrimination-violence-and-repression-from-the-1980s-to-2016">3.1 Cycles of discrimination, violence and repression from the 1980s to 2016</h2>
<p>Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other predominantly Turkic Muslim peoples living in Xinjiang have long faced discrimination and persecution by their government, including with respect to their freedom of movement and freedom of religion and cultural practice as well as access to employment, education, and health care. This historical discrimination lessened with the “open door” policy launched in the late 1970s and the subsequent economic reforms, which catalyzed a religious revival in the XUAR as in the rest of the PRC. The authorities allowed the reopening of mosques, many Muslims were allowed again to travel to Islamic countries, and contacts with Muslims abroad were encouraged.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The emergence of independent Central Asian states with the breakup of the Soviet Union, protracted conflicts in other neighbouring countries, fears that Islam might provide a rallying point for ethnic nationalism, and concerns that Islamist movements abroad might inspire young Uyghurs who had gone to study in foreign Islamic schools all appear to have heightened the Chinese authorities’ fears of organized political opposition in the XUAR, leading to a reversal of the relatively liberal policies implemented during the 1980s. Since the late 1980s, the return to restrictive policies and other factors have generated growing ethnic discontent in the XUAR. The continuing influx of Han Chinese migrants, discrimination, unequal economic opportunities, curbs on religious and cultural rights, and enforcement of the government’s birth control policy are among the factors fuelling unrest. The increasing interethnic tensions have led to cycles of sporadic violence and heavy-handed repression</p>
<p>These fears were reinforced by incidents of violence during the mid-1990s.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> At that time, the government closed many mosques and Qur’anic schools, stopped the use of Arabic script, imposed tight controls on the Islamic clergy, and dismissed or arrested religious leaders deemed to be too independent or “subversive”. Muslims working in government offices and other official institutions were prohibited from practising their religion under threat of losing their jobs. In 1996, the government intensified its campaign against “national separatists”, “religious extremists”, and “illegal religious activities”, launching at the same time an “in-depth atheist education” campaign to purge grassroots Communist Party committees and other institutions of Muslim believers.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the start of the “Global War on Terror”, restrictions on Muslims increased as China began to classify Uyghur dissidents as terrorists and to pressure the rest of the world to designate Uyghur separatist groups as terrorist organizations.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The authorities cultivated informants to report on the content of sermons in an attempt to monitor imams and prevent mosques from being used to disseminate separatist ideas or extremist religious thought. The government carried out “ethnic unity education” campaigns during religious festivals,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> and specifically targeted the celebration of Ramadan, with authorities forbidding fasting by students and government employees.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Religious education was strictly prohibited for minors, who were also banned from entering mosques.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The authorities also outlawed private religious instruction outside the auspices of officially sanctioned religious organizations.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Policies of repression grew further in the aftermath of several incidents of violence that occurred between 2009 and 2013, including the riots in Ürümqi that erupted on 5 July 2009. According to official counts, the rioting left nearly 200 dead and at least 1,700 injured, with most of the casualties reported to be Han.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Many hundreds of Uyghurs were detained as police made house-to-house sweeps following the riots, and swift justice was handed down to those alleged to be responsible for the violence. The courts handed down numerous death sentences and heavy prison terms.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Dozens of other detainees are reported to have been victims of enforced “disappearances”, being held by authorities without any notification to family members.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to repressive criminal-justice measures, other measures that fall under the broad category of “social management” were designed to prevent instability in the first place. These included an increase in the number of police in Xinjiang: 8,000 officers were hired with the goal of establishing a police presence in more rural parts of the region.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Campaigns aimed at further restricting religious practice and equating such practice with “extremism” expanded. Prohibiting the wearing of beards by men and veils and headscarves by women has been a particular focus.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> In some of the region’s villages, the authorities compelled residents to pledge to abide by codes of conduct (<em>cungui minyue</em>) aimed at preventing “illegal religious activity”.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Around this time, the mass surveillance of ethnic minorities also intensified.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Tens of thousands of high-definition cameras were installed in locations throughout the region, especially in Ürümqi of, in an effort to achieve “seamless” surveillance.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> In 2013 President Xi Jinping announced an internment strategy and put 200,000 cadres into villages in the region.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2014, in the aftermath of several stabbing and bombing attacks, the surveillance and repression increased significantly with the start the government’s “Strike Hard Against Violent Terrorist Activity” campaign.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>According to scholars, the 2014 Strike hard campaign marked a turning point in the government persecution of ethnic minorities with the start of a “people’s war, which identified the terrorist threat as coming from Uyghur culture itself.”<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Religious practice was even more tightly restricted. The government imposed bans on religious appearances and religious education and restricted halal food. Travel to Mecca was banned.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> The government also sent religious “extremists” in southern Xinjiang to “transformation through re-education” camps.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> A national security law authorized sending people to 15 days of “re-education” at the government’s discretion.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Reports emerged of “re-education camps” in limited settings.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>As part of the Strike Hard campaign, Uyghurs were required to obtain new identification, which restricted their mobility.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> All SIM cards and electronic communication devices were required to be registered.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Virtual private networks were outlawed.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Security officers regularly checked smartphones.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> The government also began a “voluntary” campaign of mass biometric data collection, which was anything but voluntary: refusal to participate could lead to being flagged as “suspicious”.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>China also began a policy of predictive policing to identify people likely to become “terrorists”.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> The intrusive nature of the data gathered to support the predictive policing campaign was justified by the government’s anti-terrorism law.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> It gave the authorities access to communication, travel, and work history; social media profiles; Internet search history; financial information; and family connections.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> The data is aggregated and entered into the government’s Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), which is a big data collection program that analyzes the information gathered by government cadres and electronic surveillance systems throughout Xinjiang and determines whether the person is “normal” or “untrustworthy”.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> (For more on IJOP see Chapter 4 below.)</p>
<p>In 2015, China passed a new counterterrorism law, which further violated ethnic minorities’ rights to freedom of religion and expression by giving legal justification for persecuting people who peacefully practice religion or criticize the government.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> The law also required technology firms to help the government to decrypt information.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 2016, two years into the government’s Strike Hard campaign, Chen Quanguo become Party Secretary of the XUAR.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Chen was notorious for the draconian security restrictions he had placed on Tibetans, included instituting “grid policing”.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> Shortly after he became Party Secretary, the government advertised 100,000 new security-related jobs and constructed an estimated 7,500 checkpoints or “convenience police stations”.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> The government also clamped down on the movement of ethnic minorities. Uyghur students were ordered to come home on 20 May 2017.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> Ethnic minorities were required to turn in their passports.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2017, new “Regulations on de-Extremification” were passed, prohibiting “extremist” behaviour, which includes wearing burkas, having “abnormal” beards, and refusing to take part in state cultural and recreational activities. The notoriously vague and overbroad regulation essentially criminalized many standard religious and cultural practices.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> The de-extremification regulations provided the “legal” cover for the government to expand its then-nascent internment camp system in southern Xinjiang to the rest of the region. People were no longer targeted for detention and re-education selectively; rather, huge swaths of the population were targeted collectively.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 2017, huge numbers of individuals from ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang began being sent to the camps. Hundreds of buildings were built, expanded, or repurposed as internment camps. The camps aimed to eliminate religious practice and emphasize political re-education in order to wipe out terrorism and extremism.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> (For more on the internment camps see Chapter 6-9.). The government initially denied reports of the camps, then tried to justify them as rebrand them as “vocational training camps” set up as part of a national poverty-alleviation program.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="serious-human-rights-violations-outside-of-internment-camps-since-2017">4. Serious Human Rights Violations Outside of Internment Camps since 2017</h1>
<p>In 2017, under the guise of an intensifying counterterrorism campaign, the Government of China commenced a massive escalation of its historical abuses of Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. While the government had severely restricted the human rights of ethnic minorities for decades (see Chapter 3 above), the new restrictions were dramatically more severe than anything imposed previously. An objective of the government’s campaign is to eradicate Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices and replace them with secular state-sanctioned views and activities, and ultimately to “transform” members of these ethnic minorities into obedient supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>To achieve this political indoctrination and cultural erasure, the government commenced a campaign of mass internment. More than a million men and women have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps (see Chapter X). The internment camp system is one part of a larger system of subjugation and forced assimilation in Xinjiang. The government has enacted other far-reaching policies that severely restrict behaviour outside the camps. These policies violate fundamental human rights, including security of person, movement, expression, thought, belief, conscience, religion, equal protection under the law, and privacy. These abuses are carried out in such a widespread and systematic manner that they are now an inexorable aspect of daily life in Xinjiang for millions of members of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The brutal effectiveness and tremendous scale of the government’s campaign – and the associated cover-up – derive from the government’s unprecedented use of surveillance technology coupled with its ability to mobilize huge portions of the population to enforce its will. The government relies on a nearly inescapable in-person and electronic surveillance operation designed to ensure that the behaviour of ethnic minority groups is continuously monitored and evaluated. Ubiquitous government cadres, violent security forces, and a subservient legal system act in concert – along with a substantial portion of the civilian population who have been terrorized into complicity – to conduct the surveillance and enforce illegal policies. As a result, members of the targeted ethnic groups, including those who have never been sent to an internment camp, a prison, or a situation of forced labour, live in constant fear under the highly credible threat of arrest, detention, torture, and disappearance under a draconian system of social control that denies them their basic human rights and is a constant affront to basic human dignity.</p>

<p>Since 2017, numerous behaviors that are widely considered fundamental to the practice of Islam has essentially been criminalized in Xinjiang<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Nearly all standard religious practice is treated as “suspicious” or “extremist” behaviour and is grounds for being sent to an internment camp.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> [Pseudonym 19] who worked for the government said that government officials would regularly visit the houses of Muslim families in her village to check for any signs of religious practice, and that if religious artefacts were found that those families were ask risk of being sent to camps. <a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Although restrictions reportedly vary in different parts of the region, the government has largely prohibited praying, attending mosques, teaching religion, wearing religious clothing, having religious content on your phone, eating halal food, owning religious books, films, or photographs, and having artifacts with images of Allah on them.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> Many Turkic Muslim cultural practices have also been banned or restricted.</p>
<p>Amnesty international interviewed XX Muslim men and woman who lived in Xinjiang between 2017 and early 2020. All of them described an environment that was extraordinarily hostile to the practice of Islam.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> None of them felt comfortable displaying any signs of religious practice when they were living in Xinjiang and all believed that doing so would result in them being detained. Many said that appearing insufficiently secular – that is, not drinking alcohol, not smoking, eating non-halal foods ­– was also grounds for being classified as suspicious and sent to an internment camp.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> [Pseudonym 65], who had been involved with his local mosque for most of his life before being taken to an internment camp, told Amnesty he found that people in his village had stopped praying after his release: “Not a single person [in my village] can pray anymore. It is because the government is against religion. They are against Muslims.”<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym p1], who had been sent to a camp for his affiliation with a government-sanctioned mosque, told Amnesty how people’s behavior in his village had been modified as a result of the new restrictions that be put in place in 2017 and were still in place when he was released from the camp in 2019:</p>
<p><strong>“Now [in 2019] people have stopped talking about religion… No one comes to Friday prayers [in our village] anymore. … Every village has its own policies. In our village woman were eventually allowed to wear headscarves again… in other villages they cannot. … I’ve heard that in some villages you could read the</strong> <strong>Koran, but in our village is completely forbidden, even today.”</strong><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 11], a Kazakh woman, described how she observed that between 2016 and 2017 government officials in her area went from targeting certain “categories” of religious people – for example, those who dressed in a religious manner or government officials (who are required to be secular) – to targeting all Muslims. She told Amnesty that in 2016 the government started imprisoning Uyghur men with religious beards and women who wore hijabs. “This was before the internment camps [started],” she said. In 2017, she said the local government officials started searching all Muslims and Muslim households for signs of religious practice. She described the lengths her family went to try to hide the religious artefacts in their house:</p>
<p>“<strong>[Security agents] stated checking phones in the street and searching for Korans and prayer mats and prayer beads [in our house] … We had to get rid of these things. … We couldn’t just throw [our Korans] away so we put them in a pot and boiled it, then we threw it away. We believed that if we boiled it then the police couldn’t find the finger prints on the books.”</strong><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Traditional cultural books and artefacts associated with Muslim ethnic minorities have also been banned; members of ethnic minority groups were pressured to destroy these and replace them with Chinese books and art.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>Several people who spoke with Amnesty reported that their houses was searched and many reported burning or destroying all of their books and cultural artefacts related to Islam or Uyghur or Kazakh culture.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> “There was an announcement that everyone should bring in their books [to the government office] … We had a bookshelf.

They would call us to [the village administration office] and feed us.

<p>Amnesty International also interviewed several people who said the government prevented them from carrying out traditional rituals and ceremonies for marriages, baby-naming and funerals. <a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> “Now if someone dies only direct relatives come to funerals,” [Pseudonym P1] said.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> [Pseudonym 19], a Uyghur woman and camp survivor, recounted how government officials had stripped the religious aspects from traditional ceremonies in her village:</p>
<p><strong>“Weddings are now held according to instruction of government.

<h2 id="arbitrary-detention">5.1.1 Arbitrary detention </h2>
<p>Since March 2017, an estimated one million or more men and women from predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been detained and sent to what the government refers to as “vocational training centres” or “transformation-through-education”.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> These facilities are more accurately described as internment camps. Amnesty International interviewed XX people – XX men and XX woman – who had been sent to these camps. All of these survivors were detained arbitrarily for non-violent and, by all reasonable standards, lawful conduct.</p>
<p>The process by which survivors were detained appears to be taking place outside the scope of the criminal justice system and other existing domestic law. The process is also in violation of numerous fundamental aspects of international human rights law . All of the detainees were denied due process during and after their initial detention. None were allowed access to legal counsel. None were provided with an arrest warrant or even a reason for their detention that included a credible allegation of a known criminal offense under Chinese law or for any offense that would traditionally be considered a crime in any country that guarantees equal protection under the law.</p>

<h2 id="reasons-for-detention">5.1.2 ‘Reasons’ for detention</h2>
<p>Some detainees were provided with a reason for their detention at the time they were initially detained; however, many were not provided with a reason for their detention until after they were sent to an internment camp, and often not until shortly before they were released, when they were forced to “confess” to “crimes”.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a> Several were given different reasons for their detention when they were detained than they were when they were released.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a> Some were never given a reason.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Individuals interviewed by Amnesty International said that the reasons they were given for their detention were often not tied to specific acts; rather, detainees were informed that they had been detained because they had been classified as a “suspicious” or “untrustworthy” person, or as a “terrorist” or an “extremist.”<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a> The criteria for such classifications are not known; however, the government of China has used these terms – particular “terrorist” and “extremist” -- in overbroad ways in the context of counterterrorism legislation.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>When specific acts were mentioned, they generally fell into a few broad categories. One category includes offenses related to foreign countries. Numerous survivors were detained for living, travelling, or studying abroad or for communicating with people abroad.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a> Many were detained for being “connected” with people who lived, travelled, studied, or communicated with people abroad.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Another category includes offenses related to unsanctioned digital software or communications technology. Many survivors were arrested for using or having forbidden software applications on their mobile phones, especially WhatsApp.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Another common category includes anything related to religion. Several survivors were arrested for reasons related to Islamic beliefs or practice, including working in a mosque, praying, having a prayer mat, or possessing a picture with a religious theme. <a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>Other survivors said they were detained for having too many children or otherwise violating China’s family planning policies.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a> One survivor said they had been detained for refusing to work for the government.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a> [Pseudonym D2], who while detained helped dozens of other inmates fill in “confession” forms on which they were required to list their “crimes”, said the most common reason she observed was “having multiple household registrations”, which is prohibited under Chinese law.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a> (For more on self-confession forms, see Chapter X below.) One survivor, who was told just prior to her release that one of the reasons she had been arrested was for having multiple household registrations, told Amnesty that she had no idea that multiple registrations was illegal and had no idea she was still registered at her family’s home where she grew up. She believed that the government was just using this a pretext to detain whoever they wanted.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Several survivors told Amnesty they had been detained after receiving explicit permission to do the very thing they were reportedly arrested for. [Pseudonym B3] told Amnesty he was detained for travelling domestically, even though he had obtained prior approval to do so from the appropriate authorities.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a> [Pseudonym C1] told Amnesty he was detained twice for travelling – once abroad and once domestically – even though he had gotten permission from the appropriate authorities to do so both times.</p>
<p><strong>“[After I was detained the second time] I asked the village chief [why I was arrested]. He said: ‘We are doing what we are told. We don’t know why. All people who are travelling abroad go to the camp. You have no right to ask questions. If you ask it will be seen as resistance. It will not be good for you. You will get answers in the camp.’”</strong><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>The reasons for detention provided by camp survivors to Amnesty International are consistent with testimonial and documentary evidence that journalists and other human rights investigators have gathered.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a> Most significantly, the reasons are broadly consistent with two leaked government documents, which together contain government records of over 2,300 people who were arrested and sent to internment camps in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> The documents – referred to as the Karakax list<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> and the Aksu list,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a> after the prefectures in Xinjiang where the people named in the documents live – contain, among other things, the official reasons the individuals were detained and interned.</p>
<p>The Aksu list includes government records on over 2,000 people who were detained and interned after being flagged by China’s Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP),<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> a big-data collection programme that gathers information about people in Xinjiang (see Chapter 3). The list reveals that “suspicious” behaviour often leading to arrest and detention includes regular religious practice, such as reciting the Qur’an or wearing religious clothing, having more children than permitted by China’s policies, using certain computer software, such as Skype or a virtual private network (VPN), travelling abroad, or travelling domestically without permission, having “extremist thoughts”, being untrustworthy, or being young.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>The Karakax list includes government records on over 400 people. The most common reason for arrest – shared by nearly half the detainees – was that they violated China’s birth control policies.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a> A scholarly analysis of reasons revealed that they fall broadly into eight non-mutually exclusive categories, including untrustworthiness, anything religion-related, and anything linked to [countries/locations] abroad.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> </p>
<p>According to another internal document leak – the so-called China Cables – hundreds of thousands of individuals have been arrested for using certain mobile phone applications. The documents also explicitly instruct authorities to arrest Uyghurs with foreign citizenship and to deport those living abroad back to China.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>The Xinjiang Victims Database documents the testimonies of internment camps survivors, their families, and other witnesses.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> While the data the project has collected is not necessarily representative of the interned population as a whole, analysis of 3,613 testimonies shows that the most common suspected reasons for detention are related to religion, going abroad, having contact with the outside world, or the behaviour of the internees’ relatives. Additionally, an analysis of the official reasons 1,486 individuals were detained indicates that other common reasons include separatism, violating birth policies, and extremism, as well as vague reasons such as belonging to heterodox groups, being an untrustworthy person, or disturbing public order.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Government officials have also reported that they were required to fulfil arrest quotas and that people were essentially arrested randomly.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>The instances of arbitrary detention documented in this report are violations of international law. Moreover, collectively, the acts constitute the crime against humanity of imprisonment (for more on crimes against humanity, see Chapter 10).<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="guilt-by-association">5.1.3 Guilt by association</h2>
<p>Analyzed in concert with the Aksu and Karakax lists and other testimonial and documentary evidence gathered by journalists, the testimonial evidence Amnesty International has gathered, demonstrates that ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are often detained on the basis of “guilt by association”. Many were interned as a result of their relationships, or perceived or alleged relationships, with family, friends, or community members – many, if not most, of whom were themselves only “guilty” of behaviour that would be considered lawful by any reasonable standard.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a> Many survivors were arrested for having a family member who was suspicious, untrustworthy, or considered to be an extremist, separatist, or “terrorist”, or for contacts with terrorists or unreliable or suspicious people.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed several survivors who believe that their behaviour was the reason their family members were arrested.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a> [Pseudonym X4] went abroad and did not return on time. He told Amnesty his father was sent to the camps because of his decision.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> [Pseudonym A1], who also did not return from abroad on time, said the police called him from his house in China and had his son ask him to return from abroad and tell him the family would be sent to the camps if he did not. Since then, he has not been able to communicate with his family. “I do not know where my children are,” [Pseudonym A1] said.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> [Pseudonym 14], a camp survivor, told Amnesty that his father was taken to an internment camp because he “let” him go abroad after he was released. “When my father was about to be detained, the police call me and said come [back to China]… they said we will let your father go if you come back.”<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to often being grounds for detention, guilt by association is now a pervasive theme in the life of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It is a tool for the social control that the Government of China imposes on the population. As illustrated in a variety of ways throughout this report, the behaviour of members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang affects their family, their community, and the group as a whole. Credible threats against family members are regularly used to control or modify behaviour (see chapter X and X below).</p>
<h2 id="interrogations-torture-and-other-ill-treatment-in-police-stations">5.2 Interrogations, torture and other ill-treatment in police stations </h2>
<p>The majority of survivors Amnesty interviewed were interrogated at police stations before being sent to a camp.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a> Several survivors reported being interrogated multiple times in police stations.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a> A minority were sent directly to the camps without being interrogated.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a> Most of the interrogations focused on questions about what the person had purportedly been detained for (that is, anything related to foreign countries, to religion, or to having “illegal” photos, videos, or software on their phone). Interrogations usually lasted several hours. Several people reported being extorted during the interrogations, saying they were told that if they paid the police they would not be sent to a camp.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>The content of the interrogations in police stations was very similar to interrogations survivors went through inside the camps and after their release. Many survivors described being asked the same questions over and over again by different government officials during multiple interrogations over the course of months and even years while in detention.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>Several survivors were tortured or otherwise ill-treated during interrogations in police stations before being transferred to the camps.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> Interrogations and torture were often carried out by members of the domestic security police, known as Guobao;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a> some were carried out by local police.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> Survivors were often interrogated in “tiger chairs”— steel chairs with affixed leg irons and handcuffs .<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a> Several were hooded and shackled during interrogations.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a> [Pseudonym W1], who spent a year in the camps for visiting Kazakhstan, said he was interrogated for several hours while immobilized in a tiger chair: “I was seated on a metal chair. Hands were cuffed. I was interrogated. My feet were also cuffed… It’s a metal chair that contains a board that your hands are cuffed to. And there is an iron base that you put your legs inside. [The interrogation started late at night,] I was questioned until 3am.”<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym V1], who was arrested for going abroad, told Amnesty he was repeatedly beaten and assaulted with an electroshock weapon during interrogations:</p>
<p><strong>“They took me to the office [in the police station]. They took me into the interrogation room… There was a tiger chair in [the room]. It was made of steel. I sat on</strong> the <strong>tiger chair and they gave me a notebook, and gave me</strong> a <strong>half hour to write down everything that I did... Then at 2am they started to beat me. Four [police] had electric sticks. [All four] tased me until the batteries on the electric sticks died… They were asking me about who I met abroad.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym VI] was released after his interrogation and was subsequently interrogated and tortured several more times before being sent to a camp.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Many survivors told Amnesty International that they were held in crowded conditions before being sent to the camps. [Pseudonym F1], who was held in a detention centre for three weeks before being transferred to a camp, told Amnesty he was forced to stand in a small crowded cell with 50 other inmates all day. “We don’t even put cows in that terrible condition… We slept side by side touching each other,” he said.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Journalists and other organizations have reported approximately a dozen similar accounts of torture and ill-treatment, including beatings and sleep deprivation in police stations and detention centres.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="medical-examinations-and-biometric-data-collection">5.3 Medical examinations and biometric data collection </h2>
<p>Before being sent to a camp, nearly all detainees were subjected to a medical examination.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> [Pseudonym X2], a camp survivor who worked at a hospital where some people were examined before they were sent to the camps, witnessed large numbers of detainees being brought to the hospital, as well as part of the medical examination process.</p>
<p><strong>“In [the city I lived in] there were four hospitals – infection, military, traditional, and regular</strong>. I<strong>n 2017 they all started being used for people sent to re-education camps… At first it was Uyghurs and Dungans. They were simple people, but police treated them as serious criminals. There were six guards per person [brought for a medical examination]. Their eyes were covered, hooded, and their hands were cuffed [when they arrived at the hospital]. The whole medical examination was top secret… [The staff at the hospital] had to make sure they were healthy. [The staff] had to draw their blood to make sure they were healthy… They were all young. I was there helping with [redacted]… The targets were young graduates. [At the time, at the hospital I worked at it was] mainly</strong> <strong>Dungans who studied [abroad].”</strong> <a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to medical exams, all survivors told Amnesty International they were required to allow government officials to collect their biometric data.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a> This almost often included multiple photographs, fingerprints, an iris scan, a voice recording, and writing sample. Biometric data was often collected at police stations. Several survivors said they believe DNA samples were taken: “Then we went to a police station for what I think was a DNA exam… They took our blood, spread it on something, and put it in a plastic wrap,” [Pseudonym X2] told Amnesty when describing her arrest.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>These reports of health checks and biometric data collection are consistent with other survivor accounts reported elsewhere and with reports of widespread campaigns for biometric data collection from all people in Xinjiang, not just those sent to the camps.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>After undergoing a medical exam and having their biometric data collected, nearly all detainees are taken to internment camps.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a> Nearly all were handcuffed while being transferred to the camps. Many are hooded and shackled.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a> “You can’t see through the hood.

<p>Many were driven to the camps in vans or buses with large numbers of detainees.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> [Pseudonym B2], who was arrested for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty about being transferred to the camp: “They came in the morning. The police entered our cell [in the police station]. They put a black hood [on me]. Handcuffed me. And dragged me to the bus. And then took us to the camp,” he said.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a> [Pseudonym 63], an older woman who was arrested for praying, told Amnesty she was taken from a police station in the middle of the night, handcuffed to another woman, put into a truck with about 20 other detainees from her village, and then driven to a camp.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162" role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="life-inside-the-internment-camps">6. Life Inside the Internment Camps </h1>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed XX survivors of XX internment camps. From the moment they enter a camp, detainees’ lives are extraordinarily regimented; the conditions in camp are “prison-like”. They are essentially stripped of their personal autonomy; every aspect of their lives is dictated to them. Detainees who deviate from the conduct proscribed by camp authorities – even in the most seemingly innocuous ways – are reprimanded and regularly physically punished, often along with their cellmates.</p>
<p>Detainees have no privacy. They are monitored at all times, including when they eat, sleep, and use the toilet. Detainees have no right to speak. They are forbidden from talking freely with other detainees. When detainees are permitted to speak – to guards or in class – they are required to speak in Mandarin, a language many of them, especially older people and people from more rural areas, do not speak or understand.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a> Detainees have been physically punished if they speak in a language other than Mandarin.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>Detainees are constantly evaluated. According to survivors as well as the leaked government document known as the Telegram, detainees are given scores. According to the Telegram, the scores measure the detainees’ “ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline.” A detainee’s behaviour effects his or her score, which factors into the treatment they receive in the camp, including “rewards, punishments, and family visits”, as well as when they are released.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a> (For more on the release process, see section 8.1 below.)</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the camps, detainees are searched, their personal effects are confiscated, and they are made to remove certain items of clothing, including shoelaces, belts, buttons, and anything else that could be used as a weapon or as an implement with which to take their own life.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a> Women internees often have their hair cut off after arriving.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a> Religious men have their heads and beards shaved.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after being searched, detainees are taken to their cells. Cells in internment camps are basic rooms, usually holding about eight to 20 people.

<h2 id="classification-of-internees">6.1 Classification of internees</h2>
<p>According to government documents and testimony from survivors, detainees are placed into one of three classifications or categories: normal management, strict management, and very strict management<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194" role="doc-noteref"><sup>194</sup></a> Detainees in different classifications are detained in the same camps; however, detainees are placed in cells with other detainees in the same classification.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195" role="doc-noteref"><sup>195</sup></a> Detainees’ uniforms correspond to their classification. Those in the normal management classification have blue uniforms, those in strict management have yellow uniforms, and those in very strict management have red.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196" role="doc-noteref"><sup>196</sup></a> A detainee’s classification can be adjusted in accordance with their “performance and point situation [that is, their score]”.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197" role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a> According to government documents, being in the normal management group is a necessary condition for being released from the camp (for more on criteria for release see chapter 8).</p>
<p>The exact reasons why specific internees are placed in different categories are not well understood by survivors; however, there is a general belief that detainees who were arrested for reasons related to religion are more likely to be placed in the two stricter categories.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198" role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a> According to several survivors, the normal management group was for “ordinary” crimes, such as having prohibited software on your phone; strict management was for crimes related to religion; and very strict management was for imams and for people who had previously been convicted of serious crimes “serious crimes.”<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199" role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a> Some survivors believe the classification system is, at least in part, based on a detainee’s ethnicity, because Uyghurs in their camps were much more likely to be placed in one of the stricter categories.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200" role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>The type of treatment detainees are subjected to in the camp corresponds to the classifications. Several survivors stated that they observed detainees from the different classification being treated differently.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a> [Pseudonym E2], a detainee who also worked in the camp for part of the time she was interned, described some of the differences she observed with respect to the treatment of detainees, especially related to their ability to move around the camp and to communicate with family members.</p>
<p><strong>“Most of the people in the strict management group are there for being religious clerics or somehow involved with religion… I know this because interrogations [</strong>f<strong>or detainees] sometime took place in staff room where [I spent time] … [In the camp I worked in,] the normal management group learned Chinese and were allowed to walk in the yard, the strict [management] [are allowed to] sit on their beds [some of the time], the very strict learn in their cell, are not allowed to move, and never get fresh air.</strong><a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a><strong>… The normal group gets to make a call once a week and strict group once every two weeks and visits once a month… The very strict group is not permitted to have visitors.”</strong><a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203" role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<p>With two possible exceptions, the survivors Amnesty interviewed were in the normal management category when they arrived in the camp.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a> As a result, nearly all the conclusions made in this report – like nearly all the testimonial evidence gathered about the camps from journalists and other organizations – come from evidence provided by survivors who experienced only the normal management treatment. However, given the second-hand accounts about the two stricter categories – which are observations made by survivors and staff who were in the same camps as internees in the stricter categories – it stands to reason that detainees in the stricter categories are treated much more severely and are much less likely to have been released from a camp and instead remain detained or have been transferred to prison.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205" role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym XZ], one of the two survivors Amnesty spoke with was given a yellow uniform for part of his stay. His “offense” was related to religion, also suggesting that he was likely in the strict management category during that time. Some of his treatment appears demonstrably worse than that of detainees in the normal management category: He was detained for over two years, was not allowed to call family members when others in his camp not detained for religious crimes were, he was never allowed out of his cell, and his feet were continuously shackled together for several months. “For two years, my family didn’t know if I was alive or dead,” [Pseudonym XZ] told Amnesty International.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="daily-routine">6.2.1 Daily routine</h2>
<p>The life of a camp detainee is highly regimented. With the exception of a few survivors describing the portion of their detention that took place in early 2017, every detainee stated that nearly every minute of their lives in the camps was prescribed, including the position in which they sat, when they stood, and where they looked.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207" role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a> [Pseudonym], who was detained for having WhatsApp on her phone, told Amnesty International how strict the schedule was and how physically draining each day was.</p>
<p><strong>“It was like a prison… [Every day] you get up at 5am and have to make your bed, and it had to be perfect. Then there was a flag</strong>-<strong>raising ceremony and an ‘oath</strong>-<strong>taking’. Then you went to the canteen for breakfast. Then to the classroom. Then lunch. Then to the classroom. Then dinner. Then another class. Then bed. Every night two people had to be ‘on duty’ [monitoring the other cellmates] for</strong> two <strong>hours… There was not a minute left for yourself. You are exhausted.”</strong><a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208" role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym], who was detained in early 2017 because he was labelled a terrorist for travelling to Kazakhstan and for having attended a religious school, told Amnesty International the daily regimentation became much stricter in late 2017, to the point where even resting and the direction of your gaze were regulated:</p>
<p><strong>“Before October 2017, it was a little relaxing in class. We could go to the canteen [to eat] by ourselves and we could sit relaxed in class. But after the</strong> <strong>national [security] meeting in October [2017] it became very serious… We had to be ‘on duty’ at night [monitoring our cellmates]. We were escorted to the canteen. We had no more contact with our family… We must ‘sit tight’. We cannot even turn our heads from the TV… [After it became strict]</strong> w<strong>e got up at 5am. Breakfast was done at 7. Class at 8. We have to [walk] to class through a two-met</strong>r<strong>e</strong>-<strong>high metal fence with metal ceiling; it was basically a cage… [we are escorted] to class by two guards with clubs… There is a bucket in the back of class [to urinate]. You needed permission to go [defecate]… Rest [after lunch] was mandatory, with heads on desk for two hours.

Nearly every survivor reported being given injections, and have their blood drawn.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265" role="doc-noteref"><sup>265</sup></a> Almost none were told what the injections or blood samples were for, even after they asked. “They injected me with a liquid, to clean inside my artery. They didn’t have my consent. They said that if I didn’t [allow them] then they would put me in the strict group,” [Pseudonym x40] told Amnesty International. A few were told that some of the injections were flu shots or vaccinations.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266" role="doc-noteref"><sup>266</sup></a> There is a widespread belief amongst detainees that they are being injected for other reasons: to affect their memory or to sterilize them.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267" role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
<p>While government documents indicate that detainees are required to be vaccinated, the frequency that some detainees report being injected seems suspicious. <a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268" role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a> A few survivors claim that they were give injections every couple weeks.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269" role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a> “They give pills regularly in camp.

<p>Most survivors reported become sick and weak while in the camps. Most claim they did not receive adequate health care. Many report chronic health problems. Many stated that they could no longer sit for long period with being in pain.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274" role="doc-noteref"><sup>274</sup></a> Many stated that they had problems with their memory, sleeping, and sexual performance.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275" role="doc-noteref"><sup>275</sup></a></p>
<p>According to former detainees interviewed by journalists, women held in internment camps are made to attend family planning classes and are force-fed birth control pills, injected with pregnancy prevention shots or subjected to forced IUDs.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276" role="doc-noteref"><sup>276</sup></a> [Pseudonym x87] told Amnesty that her husband was “forced” to come to her internment camp for a conjugal visit.

<h2 id="people-detained-in-hospitals">6.3.2 People detained in ‘hospitals’</h2>
<p>Four survivors told Amnesty International they were not interned in a formal camp, but instead spent the majority of their internment detained in hospitals.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a> This included three elderly survivors who were kept inside hospital rooms for nearly a year.

<p><strong>“I was at the hospital the whole summer… it is the [top] floor of a normal hospital, but it is blocked from other floors, and the windows are barred, only doctors can come in and out… I was kept in a room with six other elderly people… we were not allowed to go outside… We spent most of the day just sitting on our bed… We had lessons but I had problems hearing and my eyes were bad; they didn’t pressure me.

<p>Similarly, [Pseudonym Y1], another elderly woman, was kept in a hospital room with a group of elderly woman for several months. She told Amnesty how they spent the time:</p>
<p><strong>“[During the day] we would wake up and have breakfast in the room. We were handed papers and books. I pretended to read, but I didn’t understand anything. We would pretend to learn all day. Then we would have a meal and sleep. They taught some ‘red’ songs. They wanted us to learn Chinese words. We weren’t allowed out. We just wanted to be released.

<h2 id="doing-nothing-and-self-study">6.3.1 Doing “Nothing” and ‘Self-study’ </h2>
<p>Before the start of classes, during the first few days, weeks, or sometimes months after arriving at the internment camps, many of the survivors reported that they were essentially forced to do nothing for nearly the entire day. The only breaks were for meals or to sleep. Nearly all survivors were forced to sit or kneel in positions for hours on end, with straight backs and their hands positioned on their knees. <a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289" role="doc-noteref"><sup>289</sup></a> “We were given a small stool.

<p>Many survivors reported that this position was very painful for their knees and other parts of their body<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291" role="doc-noteref"><sup>291</sup></a>; some developed haemorrhoids and other health problems.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292" role="doc-noteref"><sup>292</sup></a> Many reported that inmates were physically punished if they were unwilling or unable to sit straight.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293" role="doc-noteref"><sup>293</sup></a> Several reported not being permitted to look anywhere but straight ahead.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294" role="doc-noteref"><sup>294</sup></a> [Pseudonym 19] said that she was told that if the people monitoring her cell on the cameras noticed anyone moving their lips that they would deduct from their “scores”.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295" role="doc-noteref"><sup>295</sup></a></p>
<p>Several survivors reported having to sing songs or to recite basic Chinese words while they sat still, or in a few instances stood still; others were made to watch Chinese propaganda films. Some literally had to do nothing except sit perfectly still on a small chair or stool in their room, or, in a few cases, stand still.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296" role="doc-noteref"><sup>296</sup></a> “I just sat on stool for three months from morning to 11pm… there was no class, nothing,” [Pseudonym 10] said.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297" role="doc-noteref"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym Q1], who was sent to the camp for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty he was in a camp for several months before they started taking him to class.</p>
<p><strong>“During the days before classes [started] we had to sit on stools [all day]. For 16 hours a day we had to sit on stools with our hands on our knees. We were up at 6am, then sit on stool, then breakfast… Then sit until lunch. Sometimes we were given a book [to learn from]. We could not talk to other people. We had our lunch sitting on the stool.

<p>[Pseudonym XM], who was detained for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty that for the first two months after he arrived at the camp, he was forced to sit still in an uncomfortable position for hours each day:</p>
<p><strong>“After breakfast we had to sit on our beds with our hands on our knees and a straight back. If we moved, they spoke to us through a loudspeaker [in the room] and said ‘don’t move’. Then around 11.30/12 they brought lunch. Then from 12.30 to 2 we could lie down [on our bed]. Then at 2pm they told us to maintain the seated position. We sat like that until dinner, but they sometimes said through loudspeaker that we had five minutes to move, lie down, or to urinate in the… Around 7pm we had dinner, and then we watched TV [while sitting] … At 9pm they ordered us to go to bed… We spent [the first] two months without leaving the room, [except] during the day they took us to the toilet which was outside the room to [defecate]. They took us two times a day… We never went outside.”</strong><a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299" role="doc-noteref"><sup>299</sup></a></p>
<p>The survivor testimony gathered by Amnesty is consistent with survivor accounts gathered by journalists and other organizations.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300" role="doc-noteref"><sup>300</sup></a> According to a letter from a former camp guard, inmates were not allowed to show emotion.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301" role="doc-noteref"><sup>301</sup></a></p>
<p>Based on survivor testimony, it is unclear whether doing nothing was a deliberate policy to demoralize or break the will or spirit of newly arrived detainees or if it was a consequence of the fact that at the start of the government campaign of mass incarceration certain camps were not set up to provide any formalized instruction at certain times. It is plausible that it was a deliberate policy in certain camps at certain times but not in others.</p>
<h2 id="class-or-re-education">6.3.2 ‘Class’ or ‘Re-education’</h2>
<p>The Government of China has referred to the internment camps as “vocational training centres” or “transformation-through-education”. The part of the day not spent eating or sleeping – usually 12 hours – is devoted to so-called “re-education”. The re-education in the camp is normally delivered via lectures in classrooms. In many cases, however, formal classes did not begin until an internee had been at a camp for several weeks, and often not for several months.</p>
<p>At some point after arriving in the camp, nearly all detainees are subjected to highly regimented classes, either in person, via video lectures, or both. The classes were mostly about Chinese language, history, law, and “ideology”. Some involved memorizing and reciting “red” songs. The typical schedule includes three or four hours of class after breakfast. Then detainees have lunch and a short “rest”, which often involves sitting still on your stool or with your head still on your desk.<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302" role="doc-noteref"><sup>302</sup></a> After lunch there is another three or four hours of class, and then dinner, followed by a few hours to sit or kneel on your stool and silently “review” the day’s material or to watch more “educational” videos.<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303" role="doc-noteref"><sup>303</sup></a> At nearly all times during class, internees are required to look straight ahead and not to speak with their classmates.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304" role="doc-noteref"><sup>304</sup></a></p>
<p>Classes are usually held in classrooms beyond the cells. Inmates from two or more cells are regularly brought together in one larger class with approximately 50 people. Several survivors reported having classes in their cell.<a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305" role="doc-noteref"><sup>305</sup></a></p>
<p>Internees would often have to line up or sit and wait for hours in the morning because of the logistical constraints of transferring thousands of people from cells to classrooms.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306" role="doc-noteref"><sup>306</sup></a> [Pseudonym A3] told Amnesty he spent a large portion of the day waiting to be escorted to class: “After classes started, we got moving at 6am. It took two to three hours to send all inmates to class. The class was one kilometre away. The cage line, beginning from dorm to class, is really narrow, we can only walk single file. It takes two to three hours for everyone to get there.”<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307" role="doc-noteref"><sup>307</sup></a></p>
<p>While walking to the classroom – or anywhere else in the camp – internees have to walk between yellow lines painted on the ground of the facility.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308" role="doc-noteref"><sup>308</sup></a> Anyone who steps on or over the lines risks physical punishment.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309" role="doc-noteref"><sup>309</sup></a> [Pseudonym X6], who had been sent to a camp because she refused to work for the government, told Amnesty she remembered a staff member speaking about the two yellow lines on the floor of the camp. The guard reportedly said, “‘You people went outside of the path. [In this camp] you will learn to go inside the path.’”<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310" role="doc-noteref"><sup>310</sup></a></p>
<p>Internees are escorted to class by guards. Some guards have shields and electric batons.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311" role="doc-noteref"><sup>311</sup></a> When travelling from the cell to the classroom, internees sometime walk outside to another building but are almost always under some sort of caged enclosure. “The roads from the dorm to classroom were surrounded by wires and armed guard who looked like they were ready to shoot you,” [Pseudonym] said.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312" role="doc-noteref"><sup>312</sup></a> Internees were often required to march to class in a military-type formation, shouting slogans.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313" role="doc-noteref"><sup>313</sup></a> [Pseudonym M2] told Amnesty that inmates were required to march to and from class “like soldiers” and that while marching they were required to shout, “study hard, elevate yourself, eliminate separatist forces, and long live Xi Jinping!”<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314" role="doc-noteref"><sup>314</sup></a></p>
<p>The teacher and guards enter the classroom using one door and the students enter through another, which, like the cell doors, is chained to the wall. Guards are stationed inside or immediately outside the classroom.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315" role="doc-noteref"><sup>315</sup></a> Classes begin and end with the class thanking the teacher for their sacrifice.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316" role="doc-noteref"><sup>316</sup></a></p>
<p>Students and teachers are physically separated at all times. Classrooms have a hard plastic, wooden, or metal divider, usually just over a metre high, separating the students and the teachers or ‌guards.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317" role="doc-noteref"><sup>317</sup></a> A wire or metal net often fills the space above the divider.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318" role="doc-noteref"><sup>318</sup></a> Several survivors reported that there were multiple guards with weapons in the classroom with them at all times.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319" role="doc-noteref"><sup>319</sup></a> “[In my class] there were three guards on the same side as the teacher.

<p>Desks and stools in the classroom are often chained together.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321" role="doc-noteref"><sup>321</sup></a> Several survivors reported being given short pencils to write with, or the plastic tube of ink and tip from inside a disposable pen,<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322" role="doc-noteref"><sup>322</sup></a> presumably because a full-size pencil or a pen could be used as a weapon.

You can see them but you can’t cross [the barrier]. The guards are on the teacher’s side. They taught us verses from Confucius. We had to read [the verses] out loud and repeat them hundreds of times.

<p>Internees were made to sit absolutely straight while at their desks.

If you miss your home, if you cry, they will deduct from your score – they give scores to everyone – and they will say that your mind still has problems, that your ideas didn’t change.”<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325" role="doc-noteref"><sup>325</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="interrogations-forced-confessions-and-self-criticism">6.4 Interrogations, forced confessions, and ‘self-criticism’</h2>
<p>Detainees are questioned or interrogated regularly. The manner and frequency of the interrogations appears to vary widely from camp to camp and person to person. Some survivors report being interrogated once or twice during their entire stay; others report weekly interrogations.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347" role="doc-noteref"><sup>347</sup></a> As during the interrogations in police stations and detention centres (described in Chapter X), the interrogations focused on the internees’ religious practices, foreign contacts, and relationships with “suspicious” people.<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348" role="doc-noteref"><sup>348</sup></a> Numerous survivors reported being forced to “confess” to their “crime” during interrogations; several told Amnesty they had done what they were being accused of (for example, travelling abroad, downloading WhatsApp) so while they did not consider their actions criminal, they considered their confession to be honest.<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349" role="doc-noteref"><sup>349</sup></a></p>
<p>Many interrogations took place in rooms where internees sat across a desk from a government official and did not involve any ill-treatment.<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350" role="doc-noteref"><sup>350</sup></a> Many also took place in “punishment rooms”, which were usually in the basement of the camp and often involved torture and other ill-treatment (see Chapter X below). [Pseudonym O1], who was arrested for working in Kazakhstan, told Amnesty how he was interrogated in a room in the basement of his camp:</p>
<p><strong>“[Security agents] took me to an underground room and put my legs into an iron bar. My hands were handcuffed to the chair. They asked me about my biography. Where I was born, when I started school, where did I go after high school, which did I study. I told them I went to Kazakhstan. They asked me how many times I visited and were I went, and where I stayed. They asked for the names of my relatives, and what [my relatives] did, did they pray? … they asked which cities in Kazakhstan I visited, which countries I visited. They also asked about [my siblings] … they asked ‘when you were in Kazakhstan did you learn how to pray?”</strong><a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351" role="doc-noteref"><sup>351</sup></a></p>
<p>Internees are also regularly required to engage in “confession” or “self-criticism” letters in which they admit to their “crimes” in writing. Some survivors reported having to write self-criticism letters once or twice during their interment; others reported this was a weekly or biweekly activity.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352" role="doc-noteref"><sup>352</sup></a> Several survivors reported being given a list of “crimes” from which to choose two to confess to.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353" role="doc-noteref"><sup>353</sup></a> Several said that the list had 75 crimes.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354" role="doc-noteref"><sup>354</sup></a> Journalists have also reported there were 75 types of crimes to choose from.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355" role="doc-noteref"><sup>355</sup></a> Several survivors told Amnesty they believed that people who chose – or were made to choose – certain crimes, particularly crimes related to religion, were given prison sentences (see chapter 8).<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356" role="doc-noteref"><sup>356</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to confessing one’s crimes, as part of the self-criticism, internees were made to describe in writing what they did wrong, to explain that as a result of the education they were receiving they had recognized the error of their ways and that their thoughts had been “transformed”, to express gratitude to the government for the education, and to promise not to return to their old habits.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357" role="doc-noteref"><sup>357</sup></a> [Pseudonym], who was put in a camp for having contact with people who had “extremist” thoughts, said he was forced to admit his crime and that he was told that if he did not confess he would be sent to a punishment room.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>358</sup></a> “Once a month there was self-assessment acknowledging that you did a crime and that you are not a good person,” [Pseudonym XX] told Amnesty International.

So I chose two. And I put my fingerprint on it.”</strong><a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360" role="doc-noteref"><sup>360</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X7], who was in a camp for a year, told Amnesty that civil servants who lived outside the camp, and who she likened to case managers, used to come to do interrogations and what she referred to as self-assessment’ and confessions, in which detainees were required to confess to their crime, reflect on their “progress”, and often to disavow the Muslim religion.</p>
<p><strong>“At the beginning [the civil servants] tell you your crime – [one of mine was] having WhatsApp [and travelling to Kazakhstan] – then you have to write: ‘I didn’t know having WhatsApp was a crime. I didn’t know it caused damage to CCP. Because of WhatsApp my mind was ‘compromised’. Now, after this education, I am getting better. I will not have WhatsApp on my phone again… [My other crime was going to Kazakhstan. I had to write:] I was in Kazakhstan. I got infected by ‘ideas’. Now I will do better and get rid of ideas… And [we also have to write] we have mistakenly chosen the religion of Islam. We will not choose this religion again… And there was also a list of ‘misdoings’ of Muslim believers against China. For example, praying before bed. So you would have to write that you were sorry for this and that you would not do it again.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X7] told Amnesty International she was required to do a self-assessment once a week. “It was the same every week, except that you must acknowledge some progress, like learning Chinese,” she said.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>361</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="torture-and-other-ill-treatment-in-internment-camps">7. Torture and Other Ill-Treatment in Internment Camps</h1>
<p>Every camp survivor Amnesty International interviewed was tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (in this report referred to as “torture and other ill-treatment”) during their internment. Torture and other ill-treatment are constitutive elements of life in the internment camps.</p>
<p>The torture and other ill-treatment that detainees experience in the camps fall into two broad categories. The first category includes the physical and non-physical (that is, mental or psychological) torture and other ill-treatment experienced by <em>all</em> detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps. This includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native tongue, living under the constant threat of violence, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. The camps are designed to ensure that these types of torture and other ill-treatment are an inescapable aspect of daily life for every detainee.</p>
<p>The second category includes physical torture and ill-treatment that occurs during interrogations or as punishment for misbehaviour. This type of treatment commonly includes beatings, electric shocks, solitary confinement, deprivation of food and water, exposure to cold, and the prolonged use of restraints, such as tiger chairs.</p>
<p>The instances of torture and other ill-treatment documented below (and in Chapter 5) are violations of international law. Moreover, collectively, the acts constitute the crime against humanity of torture (for more on crimes against humanity, see Chapter 10).<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362" role="doc-noteref"><sup>362</sup></a></p>

<p>States have a legal obligation to treat people in detention humanely and with dignity.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363" role="doc-noteref"><sup>363</sup></a> Under international law, torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are absolutely prohibited and cannot be justified under any circumstances whatsoever. The prohibition, enshrined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, has become a rule of customary international law, which is binding on states even if they have not ratified the relevant human rights treaties. It is also a peremptory norm, a <em>jus cogens</em> rule, with no reservations or derogations permitted.<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364" role="doc-noteref"><sup>364</sup></a></p>

<p>“any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.”<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366" role="doc-noteref"><sup>366</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="torture-and-other-ill-treatment-during-interrogations-and-as-punishment">7.1.1 Torture and other ill-treatment during interrogations and as punishment </h2>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed XX women and XX men who were tortured or subjected to other ill-treatment during interrogations or punishments in internment camps in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019.<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>379</sup></a> Amnesty also interviewed X woman and X men who either witnessed the torture or other ill-treatment of other detainees, or spoke with other detainees – usually their cellmates – who informed them that they had been tortured or otherwise ill-treated during interrogations or as punishment.<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380" role="doc-noteref"><sup>380</sup></a></p>
<p>Torture methods included beatings, electric shocks, stress position, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, being hung from the wall, being subjected to extremely cold temperatures, and solitary confinement.<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381" role="doc-noteref"><sup>381</sup></a> Amnesty International documented one account of a killing in an internment camp caused by torture.<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382" role="doc-noteref"><sup>382</sup></a></p>
<p>Survivors and witnesses described a broadly consistent pattern of treatment of detainees by Chinese security forces. Some of this treatment reflects patterns of torture and other ill-treatment that Chinese security forces have carried out in Xinjiang and other parts of China for decades.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383" role="doc-noteref"><sup>383</sup></a> According to survivors, the torture and other ill-treatment was carried out both by camp guards and by domestic security police officers (Guobao) who came to the camps for the purposes of interrogating detainees.<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384" role="doc-noteref"><sup>384</sup></a></p>
<p>Torture and other ill-treatment usually took place in interrogation or punishment rooms. These rooms are usually windowless and contain at least one tiger chair, which is used for interrogations. Some survivors reported that tiger chairs were brought into their cells. A few survivors reported being punished in rooms with multiple tiger chairs.<a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385" role="doc-noteref"><sup>385</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="first-hand-accounts-of-torture-during-interrogations-or-as-punishments">7.1.2 First-hand accounts of torture during interrogations or as punishments</h2>
<p>X survivors told Amnesty International they were interrogated in a tiger chair or other metal chair, or while handcuffed to a regular chair.<a href="#fn386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref386" role="doc-noteref"><sup>386</sup></a> Several reported being hooded for all or part of the interrogation. Interrogations usually lasted an hour or more; punishments were often much longer. Several people reported being left tied to a tiger chair for 24 hours. A few reported being immobilized in a tiger chair for multiple days.<a href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387" role="doc-noteref"><sup>387</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym P1], who was detained for an offense related to the practice of Islam, told Amnesty International that during the year he spent in an internment camp he was taken to punishment rooms twice, where he was immobilized in a tiger chair. The first time was for making his bed too early in the morning. The second time, he was taken along with the rest of his cellmates, who were punished together because one member of the cell had spoken in Kazakh.</p>
<p><strong>“[The first time I was taken I was on ‘night duty’ with an old Hui man. It was morning. We thought it was time to start making the beds. Then, on the loudspeaker, someone said it wasn’t time to start making the beds. Then [two guards] came into the room and took [the two of us who were on duty] to the [punishment] room. The room had eight chairs. We were there for maybe five hours. We didn’t have water. There was no food. And no toilet. They opened the window. It was very cold. We stayed strapped in chair. The chair is metal and we were cuffed with arms straight out. Our legs were cuffed… The second time, there was a guy [in my cell] who spoke in Kazakh. And the guards asked him if he spoke in Kazakh. And he said ‘no’. And then they took [everyone in the cell] to the tiger chair.”</strong><a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388" role="doc-noteref"><sup>388</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X1], an elderly woman who spent a year in the camp without ever being given a firm reason for her arrest – although she believes it was because she had gone to Kazakhstan – was taken to a punishment room because she argued with a cellmate after trying to come to the defence of another woman who was hard of hearing and was being verbally abused. She described being taken by two female guards to a small, dark, cold, and windowless room in the basement of the camp, where she was handcuffed and shackled and made to sit on an iron chair for three days:</p>
<p><strong>“Two women took me to the room. They held me under my arms. They told me to sit on an iron chair… [They] cuffed my arms and legs… My hands were cuffed to each other, not to the chair... [I was taken because] there was a woman [in my cell] who couldn’t hear well. And there was another Uyghur woman [in the cell] who used to call her names. I said [to the Uyghur woman], ‘why are you taking advantage of her? You shouldn’t do that!’ [Then an argument started.] Then the guards came [in the cell] and asked us what happened and they took me to this room… It was a dark room. No toilet in it. Just a bucket… There was no bed, just a chair. They brought one piece of bread and water. I was getting pretty cold. I started shouting that I was getting cold… My hands and legs were cuffed [to the chair] … They told me I would be there for five days. [But] the following day they took my cuffs off and brought food. And [the guard] watched through the door and told me to eat. But I was cold and couldn’t eat… I was there for three days.”</strong><a href="#fn389" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref389" role="doc-noteref"><sup>389</sup></a></p>
<p>Several internees told Amnesty International they were sent to punishment rooms multiple times. [Pseudonym X8], a farmer, described to Amnesty how he was tortured multiple times in two camps during his time in detention – both during an interrogation and during multiple punishment sessions. He described his interrogation session:</p>
<p><strong>“That day two guards came to my cell. They said I would be interrogated. I stuck my hands out through the hole in the wall [door] and they cuffed me [from the other side of the door]… [I could hear] the guards talking on the walkie-talkie saying that ‘Guobao is waiting’… Two guards took me from the cell and dropped me off [at the room where I was interrogated]. Two men were inside. They locked the door from inside. The guards were in uniform but the plainclothes [Guobao officers] interrogated me… They started asking about personal information, ethnicity, date of birth, when I went to Kazakhstan, my occupation… [they asked] ‘did you pray there? What do your parents do?’ I said I only stayed with family, that I took care of livestock, and that I didn’t do anything illegal… they asked me about mosque and praying… If I told them I had been praying, I had heard that I would get sentenced for 20 or 25 years. So I told them I never prayed. Then they became upset. They said, ‘All that time with livestock, you became an animal too!’ Then they hit me with a chair until it broke… I was sitting on a chair and they hit me with another chair. They hit me until the chair broke. I fell to the floor. I almost fainted… Then they put me on the chair again. They said, ‘this guy hasn’t changed yet, he needs to stay [in the camp] longer’… then they walkied the guards, who helped me back to the cell.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X8] was also sent to two punishment rooms on multiple occasions for trivial offenses.</p>
<p><strong>“[The first time I was taken in the first camp] it was because I tried to look out the window. There was a window with a bar [in my cell]. We were not allowed to look outside… [The first time I was sent in the second camp] was because they made me the responsible person for the cell. Leaders were inspecting the cell. When they came in [to inspect our cell] we had to stand up and show respect but my cell didn’t do it so I was sent to punishment room… [The second time I was sent to the punishment room in the second camp] was one day before I was released. It was because I didn’t sit still in the classroom.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X8] was tortured in both camps. He told Amnesty he was repeatedly electrocuted while being asked repetitively whether he “would do it again”. “[I had to say that] ‘I made a mistake but will not do it again,” he said. “The first time they electric shocked me. Then they tied me up on a chair for 24 hours without food or water… The second time they chained me up [from the wall].” He told Amnesty he was left immobilized on a tiger chair multiple times, and the room was very cold. “They would open the window on winter days,” he said.</p>
<p>[Pseudonym X8] also described two of the punishment rooms, one of which had 20 tiger chairs.</p>
<p><strong>“You can see the chair across from you, but not beside you because there are [wooden] dividers [that go to the ceiling] … Above every tiger chair there is a camera and microphone and a small white light. The light is on the ceiling. Lights are dim… There is a window but no light. The window is close to the ceiling. It is very narrow… Everything was white. The walls, floors, ceilings. All new… It is in the basement where we live… There were several other people [in the room] but I could not see [most of] them. There was one guy in front of me. I could see him. The other guy [in front of me] was punished for using his Kazakh mother tongue… We talked to each other. We had to talk in Chinese.”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 65] also described being punished and sent to a place with numerous tiger chairs – in this case they were located in a corridor of a building in the camp:</p>
<p><strong>“I was punished once. … In class I raised my hand and asked a question then [the teacher] threw a plastic ruler at me and said ‘why do you speak!’ … then [the teacher] said to the guards to take me to the tiger chair. … They tied my hands and legs to the chair. … I was lucky [because I wasn’t there for too long] … There were 10-15 chairs. … It wasn’t a real room; it was part of a corridor. … There were partitions between the chairs, like in a public toilet. You could not see the chair beside you. … There was another person in front of me [who I could see] … When the guard left I asked the man in front of me how long he had been there. He said 24 hours.”</strong></p>
<p>Confinement in tiger chairs is also often a form of solitary confinement, as the person immobilized in the chair is often left alone for hours. One survivor stated that the camps she was interned in had a “dark” room, which was a windowless room without light, about two metres by one metre, where detainees were sent if they misbehaved. She told Amnesty how she was put in the room for two days:</p>
<p><strong>“On that day a 70-year-old lady spoke her mother tongue, Uyghur, in our cell. … The guards wanted to take her to a tiger chair. I argued with them and said put me in the tiger chair. … They said that I hadn’t learned and still had extremist thoughts, so they put me in the dark room. … It’s just a room for one person. I was just lying on the floor. … When you lie down [with your head at one end] your feet almost touch the wall. … There is a toilet in the room, nothing else.”</strong><a href="#fn390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref390" role="doc-noteref"><sup>390</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="ongoing-detention-conditional-release-camp-to-labour-and-camp-to-prison">8. Ongoing Detention, Conditional Release, ‘Camp to Labour’, and ‘Camp to Prison’ </h1>
<p>In December 2019, shortly after the publication of the “China Cables” and “The Xinjiang Papers”, Shohrat Zakir, Chair of the XUAR regional government, announced that the “vocational training centres” (that is, the internment camps) in Xinjiang had been closed and that the people residing in these facilities had “returned to society.”<a href="#fn440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440" role="doc-noteref"><sup>440</sup></a> The government provided no evidence to support its sweeping assertions and, after the announcement, it continued to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent the public from obtaining information about the internment camps and the detained population.</p>
<p>At the time of the government’s announcement, however, some of the internment camps had been dismantled and a significant number of detainees had been released from the camps.<a href="#fn441" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref441" role="doc-noteref"><sup>441</sup></a> There is debate about whether the dismantling of certain camps was a consequence of there being fewer detainees, because newer facilities had been built to replace some of the original buildings, or some combination of the two. There is also significant debate about whether the decision to release at least some of the detainees was a consequence of a sea change in government policy or a result of what should be considered normal turnover for detainees who had already spent considerable time in the camps and fulfilled the criteria for being released (see below).</p>
<p>It is also plausible that many of the detainees were released as a consequence of a policy change with respect to one ethnic minority group only: ethnic Kazakhs. Testimonial evidence from survivors’ family members suggests that a significant portion of the ethnic Kazakh population detained in the camps has been released, particularly those with Kazakh citizenship or family ties to Kazakhstan.<a href="#fn442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref442" role="doc-noteref"><sup>442</sup></a> This is likely the result of effective pressure on the Government of Kazakhstan by civil-society groups in Kazakhstan to pressure the Government of China to release some ethnic Kazakh detainees.<a href="#fn443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref443" role="doc-noteref"><sup>443</sup></a></p>
<p>The release of certain detainees notwithstanding, camp survivors, family members of detainees, journalists, and scholars have argued that the government’s broad claims are false.<a href="#fn444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref444" role="doc-noteref"><sup>444</sup></a> Credible evidence suggests the internment camp system is still operating and that many people – perhaps just as many as ever – remain detained in camps or in some other form of indefinite incommunicado detention, either in prisons or situations of forced residential labour. No survivors who were present in the camps after the government’s announcement in December 2019 have spoken publicly. But testimony gathered by Amnesty International and other organizations from survivors released before the government’s announcement and from friends and family of detainees indicates that many detainees remain in the camps and that many others have been sent to prisons or situations of forced labour (for more on forced labour see Chapter 8 below).<a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445" role="doc-noteref"><sup>445</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, scholars analyzing both the available testimonies from camp survivors and family members and public court documents have argued that while the government did begin to dismantle some of the internment camps and release some of the detainees as a result of international pressure, the situation of many detainees had gotten worse because they had been given long sentences and were transferred from camps to prisons.<a href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446" role="doc-noteref"><sup>446</sup></a></p>
<p>The Chinese government’s own statistics support the contention that the prison system in Xinjiang has grown significantly since 2017. Journalists at <em>The New York Times</em>, relying entirely on government statistics, demonstrated that incarceration rates in Xinjiang increased dramatically in 2017 and 2018, with hundreds of thousands more people being sent to prisons than average, a 10- to 20-fold increase from previous years.<a href="#fn447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref447" role="doc-noteref"><sup>447</sup></a> The data reportedly includes prison sentences and “other criminal punishments, which can include suspended sentences or house detention.” It is not known if these numbers include people who were sent to camps and then transferred to prisons or only people sentenced and sent directly to prisons. Moreover, according to another report based on government statistics, in 2017 there was a dramatic increase in the number of lengthy sentences handed down by courts in Xinjiang. Before 2017, prison sentences longer than five years accounted for approximately 11% of the total number of people sentenced. In 2017, 87% of sentences were more than five years.<a href="#fn448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448" role="doc-noteref"><sup>448</sup></a> Since <em>The New York Times</em> investigation, the government has not released any more data on incarceration rates.</p>
<p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) – a think tank that monitors and analyzes the situation in Xinjiang – has gathered satellite imagery that it argues shows that, while some camps have been dismantled, the internment camp system not only continued to operate after the government’s 2019 announcement but, in fact, grew substantially.<a href="#fn449" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref449" role="doc-noteref"><sup>449</sup></a> ASPI identified more than 380 sites that it contends were newly built or expanded since 2017, including internment camps, detention centres, and prisons. Of these, ASPI categorized about 50% as what it identifies as higher-security facilities. Some argue that this suggests that minorities in Xinjiang are now being formally charged and detained in the newly expanded prisons or sent to factories for forced labour instead of being interned in the camps.<a href="#fn450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref450" role="doc-noteref"><sup>450</sup></a> According to ASPI, while in approximately 70 camps fences and perimeter walls have been removed, about 90% of those camps were what it identifies as lower-security facilities.<a href="#fn451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref451" role="doc-noteref"><sup>451</sup></a></p>

<p>Everyone, including those accused of criminal offences and victims of crime, has an equal right to access the courts, without discrimination. A fundamental principle and prerequisite of a fair trial is that the tribunal charged with making decisions in a case must be established by law and be competent, independent, and impartial. The right to a public hearing is an essential safeguard of the fairness and independence of the judicial process and is a means of protecting public confidence in the justice system.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle of the right to a fair trial is the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be presumed innocent until and unless proved guilty according to law after a fair trial. If an accused alleges during the course of proceedings that he or she has been compelled to make a statement or to confess guilt, the judge should have the authority to consider the allegation at any stage. All those charged with criminal offences have the right to defend themselves, in person or through a lawyer. They have the right to be assisted by a lawyer of their choice, or to have a competent lawyer assigned to assist them. They have the right to confidential communications with their lawyer.</p>
<p>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be tried in his or her presence and to an oral hearing so that they may hear and challenge the prosecution case and present a defence. Judgements must be made public, with limited exceptions. Everyone tried by a court of law has the right to a reasoned judgement. Punishments may lawfully be imposed only on people who have been convicted of a crime after a fair trial. Punishments must be proportionate and may not violate international standards. Conditions in prison must respect human dignity.<a href="#fn452" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref452" role="doc-noteref"><sup>452</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="the-internment-camp-release-process">8.1.1 The internment camp release process</h2>
<p>The process to determine which detainees are released from camps and which are sent to prisons or situations of forced labour is not well understood, including by many detainees. Much like the process surrounding the initial detention and transfer to the internment camp, aspects of the release process appears to be extra-legal. Nothing that survivors experienced during the time leading up to their release describes a process that includes the substantive or procedural fairness required for a legitimate legal or even an administrative hearing.</p>
<p>Leaked Chinese government documents, particularly the Telegram, provide some insight into how the government intended – at least at one point – the release process to take place.<a href="#fn453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref453" role="doc-noteref"><sup>453</sup></a> Based on testimony from survivors and witnesses and on what we know from the Telegram, the decision to release or transfer someone is essentially the culmination of a process that begins when a detainee is first detained. From that moment, there is an ongoing process of monitoring and evaluation, whereby people are given scores (for more on scores see Chapter X above). A detainee’s behaviour affects his or her score, which factors into the release determination.</p>
<p>According to the Telegram, once a detainee arrives at an internment camp there are five broad criteria that must be met to be designated as ready to be <em>considered</em> for release from the camp. The detainee must have</p>
<ul>
<li><p>been placed in the normal management group,</p></li>
<li><p>been in the camp for at least a year,</p></li>
<li><p>displayed some form of improvement with respect to his or her “problem” since arriving in the camp,</p></li>
<li><p>achieved adequate scores with respect to “ideological transformation, academic achievement, compliance and discipline, etc.,” and</p></li>
<li><p>have no “other circumstances that affect completion.”<a href="#fn454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref454" role="doc-noteref"><sup>454</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once these criteria are met, a detainee can proceed to the first of several additional evaluations undertaken by camp and other government officials. First, “a student evaluation team overseen by the Party organization secretary” undertakes a “preliminary” evaluation and then checks the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) to see if the platform has flagged any “new problems”. Then, in the absence of any new issues flagged by IJOP, the case is reported “up level-by-level” to three different groups of government cadres, the last of which is the “prefecture (state, city) vocational skills education and training service bureau” that, in concert with “comrades of the local committee”, makes the final determination about whether or not to release the detainee.</p>
<p>If the detainee is designated ready for release, the group that does the final evaluation also determines whether the detainee enters a “skills improvement class” for “intensive training” prior to being released.<a href="#fn455" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref455" role="doc-noteref"><sup>455</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family-involvement-in-the-release-process">8.1.2 Family involvement in the release process</h2>
<p>The decision to release a detainee is based in part on the behaviour of the detainee’s family, which is also being monitored, evaluated, and incorporated into the detainee’s score. A 2017 government directive on how to answer questions from minority students who wonder where their relatives are instructed cadres to tell the students that their behaviour could hurt their relatives’ scores.<a href="#fn456" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref456" role="doc-noteref"><sup>456</sup></a> Several survivors also said that after they were released they learned their family and friends had been questioned before their release and that their family members had to fill out a long questionnaire.<a href="#fn457" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref457" role="doc-noteref"><sup>457</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym J2], who worked in a village administration office and was responsible for looking through the files of people who had been sent to camps, explained to Amnesty how detainees were held responsible for the actions of their family members outside of the camps, and how family behaviour can lower the score of the individuals, which is the metric the government uses to determine who should be released.</p>
<p><strong>“When someone is [sent to a camp] it affects three generations of the family. For example, if parents are sent then it affects the son – he can’t get a job with government or police… Also, for example, the cadres staying with [the families of people who are in camps] overnight had to report back to village committee if anyone prayed. And if they find this, then the score [of the person in the camp] will be lowered<em>…</em> And if a person is sent to re-education camp then that person’s family had to attend classes. If they do [attend] then family will get good score and [the person in the camp will] get released sooner, or vice versa. We collected scores each week and sent them to re-education camps<em>.</em>”</strong><a href="#fn458" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref458" role="doc-noteref"><sup>458</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="survivors-experiences-of-the-release-process">8.1.3 Survivors’ experiences of the release process</h2>
<p>Detainees were not made explicitly aware of the government’s criteria for release; however, they generally understood that their behaviour was being constantly evaluated. Many were informed that their release was predicated on achieving certain goals, such as learning a sufficient number of Chinese characters.<a href="#fn459" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref459" role="doc-noteref"><sup>459</sup></a> Many also understood that breaking any camp rules would likely prolong their detention.<a href="#fn460" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref460" role="doc-noteref"><sup>460</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite their awareness of the evaluation, very few survivors credited their release to anything that they did or did not do in the camps.<a href="#fn461" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref461" role="doc-noteref"><sup>461</sup></a> Most attributed their release to factors that were largely or entirely outside their control, such as their Kazakh ethnicity and the fact that the government decided to release ethnic Kazakhs from the camps.<a href="#fn462" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref462" role="doc-noteref"><sup>462</sup></a> Some believe they were released because of appeals for their release made by family members living abroad.<a href="#fn463" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref463" role="doc-noteref"><sup>463</sup></a> Some have no idea why they were released.<a href="#fn464" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref464" role="doc-noteref"><sup>464</sup></a> “They released 12 people the day I was released… They said, ‘your time is up and you can go home now.’ They didn’t say why. They just released Kazakhs, not Dungans or Uyghurs,” [Pseudonym XX] told Amnesty International.<a href="#fn465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref465" role="doc-noteref"><sup>465</sup></a></p>
<p>Many survivors also believe their release was connected to the reason they were arrested; those arrested for certain “crimes” – especially religion-related offences – are believed to be much less likely to be released.<a href="#fn466" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref466" role="doc-noteref"><sup>466</sup></a> This would be consistent with several other aspects of the mass incarceration campaign and the internment camp system. Because those sent to camps for religious reasons are generally classified in the strict or very strict management categories, it stands to reason that at the very least, it would take longer for them to progress from either of those categories into the normal management category, which, according to the Telegram, is a prerequisite for release. Moreover, this belief is consistent with the available evidence about the reasons for prison sentences (see section 8.2.2 below).</p>
<p>The interviews and other procedural steps survivors described undergoing before being released are broadly consistent with the process outlined in the Telegram. Many of the survivors were questioned by camp and other government officials before release, and often by several groups of officials from different government bodies.<a href="#fn467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref467" role="doc-noteref"><sup>467</sup></a> According to [Pseudonym 26], who was arrested for having WhatsApp on her phone, the release procedure involved officials from several levels of government, including the Autonomous District Level. “It’s like a parole hearing. Civil servants came to camp. They checked my documents, asked whether I improved, whether my family is complying.

<p>The questions asked in these pre-release interviews followed a similar script. Detainees were asked about their religious practice, their contacts abroad, and other topics they had been questioned about repeatedly throughout their internment.<a href="#fn469" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref469" role="doc-noteref"><sup>469</sup></a> Nearly all detainees were required to confess to their “crimes”, to acknowledge that their past behaviour was wrong, to express how much they appreciated the education they had received, to explain how their thoughts had been “transformed”, to swear that they would not act that way again, and, often, to disavow Islam.<a href="#fn470" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref470" role="doc-noteref"><sup>470</sup></a> Detainees were also required to explain what they were planning to do after they were released.<a href="#fn471" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref471" role="doc-noteref"><sup>471</sup></a></p>
<p>Survivors believed that to be released they needed to answer all the questions in the way the government officials wanted, regardless of whether it was the truth. [Pseudonym X18] told Amnesty that in the weeks before his release he was interviewed by four different groups of government officials – “school” level [that is, camp level], county level, prefecture level, and autonomous region level – all of whom asked him similar questions and, he believes, required certain answers:</p>
<p><strong>“All the [interviews] were the same. [They asked] ‘What did you learn? Have your thoughts transformed? Do you love China? What are you going to do when you are released? Do you appreciate your re-education?’ We had to answer all the questions positively or be sent to jail. We know this… Each [of the four interviews] was one to two weeks apart, and lasted for 30 to 60 minutes… When they [arrested] us they made up one reason [for our arrest] even though we didn’t do it… [Before you are released] you have to write something. [You have to start what you write] with that reason. Then you copy a form saying you won’t pray, won’t go to a mosque, and will follow all Chinese laws.”</strong><a href="#fn472" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref472" role="doc-noteref"><sup>472</sup></a></p>
<p>Towards the end of the interview process, detainees were made to write and sign several letters and sign several official documents, including a “confession” letter, a “gratitude” letter, and at least one document stating they would not disclose anything about their internment in the camp to anyone, including to members of their family, and especially not to foreigners.<a href="#fn473" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref473" role="doc-noteref"><sup>473</sup></a> Several survivors said that they had to sign numerous documents before being released. “I had to sign 19 documents to be released,” [Pseudonym 12] said.<a href="#fn474" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref474" role="doc-noteref"><sup>474</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym I2], who was arrested for travelling to Kazakhstan, told Amnesty International he had to write and sign three letters before being released.</p>
<p><strong>“Before I was released I had to write a letter of gratitude to the Party, thanking them for feeding and educating us. And I had to write a confession letter, saying that I committed a mistake by going to Kazakhstan… you needed three letters to sign out. [The third] said [I was] not allowed to say anything about our experience in the camp and that if you do then you agree to be judged and sent back to the camp.”</strong><a href="#fn475" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref475" role="doc-noteref"><sup>475</sup></a></p>
<p>All detainees are told unequivocally that if they do disclose information about the camps they will be interned again or sent to prison.<a href="#fn476" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref476" role="doc-noteref"><sup>476</sup></a> Several survivors were told that their family members would also be sent to camps if they disclosed anything. [Pseudonym F1], who was released along with a large group of Kazakh detainees, told Amnesty International that before their release, camp officials told the group that if they disclosed anything about the camps they would be sent back to the camps along with their wives.<a href="#fn477" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref477" role="doc-noteref"><sup>477</sup></a> [Pseudonym I1] told Amnesty International he was required to write a letter of gratitude to the Party before being released and swear not to disclose anything under penalty of his family being sent to a camp:</p>
<p><strong>“[During the final time I was interrogated in the camp], a few days before I was released, I had to write down everything that happened to me in the foreign country [I visited]. And to write about communism and democracy. I knew that we had to praise communism and despise democracy so that is what I did.

Then I had to sign and put my fingerprint on the paper.”</strong><a href="#fn478" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref478" role="doc-noteref"><sup>478</sup></a></p>
<p>Some survivors were told to deny they had ever been to a camp.<a href="#fn479" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref479" role="doc-noteref"><sup>479</sup></a> Several survivors said they were coached on what to say to friends and relatives after they were released.<a href="#fn480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref480" role="doc-noteref"><sup>480</sup></a> [Pseudonym Z1] told Amnesty International that before her release she was taken to a police station, where they put makeup on her and fed her. She was interrogated repeatedly over the course of a week, during which time they also told her what to do for the video they wanted her to make: “[Before I could be released] I had to make a video saying good things about the CCP and what they had done for me, and how strong the country was, and that the [an overseas Uyghur organization] did terrorist activities, and the president of the World Uyghur Congress is bad.”<a href="#fn481" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref481" role="doc-noteref"><sup>481</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 66] told Amnesty that in order to be allowed back to Kazakhstan she had to make a very detailed video stating that here time in the camp had been voluntary, that she was treated well in the camp, and that she had learned many valuable things during her time in the camps, including why religion was bad. “I didn’t want to say these things. I had to say them to see my children,” she said.<a href="#fn482" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref482" role="doc-noteref"><sup>482</sup></a></p>
<p>Family members of detainees were also threatened with detention if they spoke about the fact that their family members had been to a camp. According to [Pseudonym J2], who worked in a village administration office, family members of about-to-be-released internees receive a call from government officials warning them not to disclose that their family member had been to a camp and threatening them with jail time if journalists ever found out anything about the family member’s internment.<a href="#fn483" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref483" role="doc-noteref"><sup>483</sup></a></p>
<p>Once detainees fulfil all the necessary conditions, they are permitted to return to their homes; however, they must do so under strict conditions limiting their movements and associations (see Chapter 9 below).<a href="#fn484" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref484" role="doc-noteref"><sup>484</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="survivors-experiences-of-the-prison-sentencing-process">8.2.1 ‘’ Survivors’ experiences of the prison sentencing process </h2>
<p>At least hundreds of thousands of people are in prisons in Xinjiang. Most are members of ethnic minority groups.<a href="#fn485" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref485" role="doc-noteref"><sup>485</sup></a> Much of the incarcerated population is sent directly to prisons. Evidence suggests that significant numbers of camp detainees have also been transferred from camps to prisons.<a href="#fn486" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref486" role="doc-noteref"><sup>486</sup></a> Scholars analyzing testimonies from camp survivors and family members, along with public court documents have argued that many detainees had been given long sentences;<a href="#fn487" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref487" role="doc-noteref"><sup>487</sup></a> however, the true number are largely speculative at this point.</p>
<p>Like the release process to which it appears to be tied (see section 8.1.2 above), the process through which camp detainees are given prison sentences is not well understood, even by former detainees who appear to have had some exposure to the process. It is also unclear exactly how the release process and the sentencing process are connected and especially how, if at all, the prison sentencing process in the camp is integrated with the formal sentencing process outside of the camps.</p>
<p>Amnesty was not able to interview anyone who was given a sentence in the camp and then sent to a prison. Amnesty did interview, however, interview XX camp detainees who were given sentences that were subsequently “forgiven”.<a href="#fn488" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref488" role="doc-noteref"><sup>488</sup></a> Amnesty International also interviewed XX survivors who said that while they were detained one or more of the people in their class received prison sentences,<a href="#fn489" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref489" role="doc-noteref"><sup>489</sup></a> including several sentences of 20 years.<a href="#fn490" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref490" role="doc-noteref"><sup>490</sup></a></p>
<p>At some point during their detention, many camp detainees receive a verdict that lists their “crimes” and often includes a “sentence”, which detainees are told is expected to be served either in the camp or in a prison. Several survivors said the verdicts were given at the end of a process referred to as a trial. However, survivors interviewed by Amnesty experienced anything that resembled a fair legal or even administrative process. They had no opportunity to defend themselves, examine the evidence, or consult a lawyer. Some survivors did not recall any real process before they received a verdict and said their verdicts and the verdicts of their classmate were just read out in class.<a href="#fn491" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref491" role="doc-noteref"><sup>491</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym T1] told Amnesty International he was taken to a “court”, which involved him answering questions similar to those he had answered during previous interrogations. He was not given a sentence but many of his cellmates who were sent through the court were.</p>
<p><strong>“A month or so</strong><a href="#fn492" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref492" role="doc-noteref"><sup>492</sup></a> <strong>before I was released, people were taken to ‘courtrooms’ and given sentences… [when I was taken to the courtroom] they just asked me what I had done… I said I had been to Kazakhstan… [The woman presiding over the process] said you need more time here. She didn’t give me a sentence… If I’m not mistaken she was a Uyghur. She had a list of questions... I was good at answering… it was just the two of us, talking in Uyghur… She already had documents about me in front of her… Everyone [in my cell] went to court. Some came back [to the cell] and said they got prison terms. Some were the same as me [and were not given any sentence] … Some of those who did [get sentenced] were then [moved out of the cell].”</strong><a href="#fn493" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref493" role="doc-noteref"><sup>493</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym E1], who was one of the few survivors who was temporarily placed in the strict management category and given a yellow badge said that approximately a year into his time in the camp, several of his cellmates were taken to “court” and given sentences. “They took people to court. A few days later [those people] get verdicts. The staff in charge [of our cell] comes to cell and reads the verdict. We can hear it read,” he said. [Pseudonym E1] provided Amnesty with the full names of two of his cellmates who were sentences, and said that one was given 15 years for gathering with others and reading a book about religion and the another was five to seven years and six months years for insulting the police and country leaders.<a href="#fn494" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref494" role="doc-noteref"><sup>494</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X9], who spent nearly a year and a half in different camps, told Amnesty International he was in a class of 50, which was approximately half Uyghur and half Kazakhs and Dungans. He said that all the Uyghurs, five Dungans, and two Kazakhs were given sentences. “They would read verdicts in class… [one man received] ‘three years for going to halal restaurant’… [another man received] ‘seven years for you having camping equipment or boxing [equipment], because then you were involved in terrorism,” he said.<a href="#fn495" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref495" role="doc-noteref"><sup>495</sup></a></p>
<p>Not everyone who receives a guilty verdict is sent to prison. It appears that some sentences are expected to be served in the camp. Two survivors told Amnesty International that people with verdicts under 10 years served them in the camp, and that people with verdicts over 10 years were sent to prison.<a href="#fn496" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref496" role="doc-noteref"><sup>496</sup></a> This largely corresponds to accounts reported by journalists.<a href="#fn497" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref497" role="doc-noteref"><sup>497</sup></a> It is also plausible that some verdicts are initially provided as scare tactics or that they could be altered with good behaviour. All survivors Amnesty interviewed were initially given guilty verdicts, and a few were given prison sentences; however, those sentences were rescinded and none of the survivors Amnesty interviewed was sent to prison.<a href="#fn498" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref498" role="doc-noteref"><sup>498</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym D1] told Amnesty that people who received sentences of 10 years or more were sent directly to prison, and that three men from his class – two Uyghurs and one Kazakh – were sent to prison. He said he was told this secretly by staff in the camp. “Those verdicts over 10 years are directly sent to prison, family gets verdict. Those teachers in camp, they talk secretly to us [and tell us that people were sent to prison],” he said.<a href="#fn499" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref499" role="doc-noteref"><sup>499</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym M2], who was in the camp for refusing to work for the government, told Amnesty International that officials started giving verdicts to people in her class several months after she arrived in the camp. “[Mine said] that I deserve five to 10 years, but that the government is merciful so I don’t need to go to prison… they said that my sin was going to a country that was on the sensitive country list and not cooperating with the neighbourhood committee.”<a href="#fn500" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref500" role="doc-noteref"><sup>500</sup></a> [Pseudonym M2] was subsequently released after an appeal from family members abroad.</p>
<p>[Pseudonym], who was sent to a camp because of his involvement with his local mosque, told Amnesty that one day while in class people were called one by one to another room and told what their verdict was:</p>
<p><strong>“People who were religious got [between] two- and 10-year prison terms. The person who was an imam in a mosque in my village was given a seven-year sentence [his name is…] ... he told me about the sentence. We were in the same room… Initially I was given three to five years but then they forgave me and I wasn’t given a prison term… They didn’t explain why. Maybe because [a relative] did an appeal for [my release] from Kazakhstan.”</strong><a href="#fn501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref501" role="doc-noteref"><sup>501</sup></a></p>
<p>The accounts of the release process given to Amnesty are consistent with accounts other survivors have provided to journalists.<a href="#fn502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref502" role="doc-noteref"><sup>502</sup></a> Testimonies given to journalists refer to “open court trials”, which can lead people to be transferred from the camps to prison.<a href="#fn503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref503" role="doc-noteref"><sup>503</sup></a> As part of this process, detainees are handed a list of infractions from which they retroactively choose a crime for which they were detained in the camps. The list allegedly includes more than 70 acts, including travelling or contacting people abroad, and religious acts, such as praying or wearing a headscarf. Some have pointed to the fact that this list could be based on brochures circulated in Xinjiang in 2014 setting out extreme religious activities and describing signs to look for and inform the police about.<a href="#fn504" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref504" role="doc-noteref"><sup>504</sup></a> Internees who refuse to choose a crime from this list are reportedly threatened with indefinite detention and forced to confess.<a href="#fn505" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref505" role="doc-noteref"><sup>505</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-prison-sentences">8.2.2 Reasons for prison sentences </h2>
<p>Testimony from survivors suggests that the reason for a detainee’s detention appears to be a significant factor in the decision to release him or her from a camp. Detainees sent to camps for religion-related “offenses” are believed to be much more likely to given prison sentences.<a href="#fn506" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref506" role="doc-noteref"><sup>506</sup></a> Ethnicity also appears to be correlated with whether a detainee is sent to a camp. Many survivors reported that Uyghurs were much less likely to be released than Kazakhs. Most of the Kazakh survivors said the vast majority of the people released from their camps were Kazakh, not Uyghur,<a href="#fn507" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref507" role="doc-noteref"><sup>507</sup></a> even though Uyghurs made up the overwhelming majority of the camp populations. [Pseudonym P1] told Amnesty that nearly all the Kazakh people were released from his camp: “I was one of the last [Kazakhs] in the camp because [I was in the camp for a reason related to religion].”<a href="#fn508" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref508" role="doc-noteref"><sup>508</sup></a></p>
<p>An analysis of the Xinjiang Victims Database comparing those who reportedly received prison sentences with those who were released from the camps reveals three trends<a href="#fn509" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref509" role="doc-noteref"><sup>509</sup></a>: (1) Men seem to be overrepresented among those who are sentenced; (2) Those who are initially sent to the camps for religious reasons appear to be more likely to be sentenced to prison than released. Second-hand testimonies of internees being sentenced to lengthy prison terms for having studied religion abroad or having been in contact with foreigners have also been reported in the news;<a href="#fn510" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref510" role="doc-noteref"><sup>510</sup></a> and (3) younger people (age 18–35) seem to be represented slightly more among those who are sentenced to prison.</p>
<h2 id="section-4"></h2>
<h2 id="camp-to-labour">8.3 ‘Camp to labour’</h2>
<p>Many detainees are sent from internment camps to situations of forced labour or are forced to work inside internment camps. According to the Telegram, after completing their “training” in the camp, detainees “will be sent to vocational skills improvement classes for intensive skills training for a school term of three to six months”.<a href="#fn511" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref511" role="doc-noteref"><sup>511</sup></a> Local governments are responsible for designing and implementing the training in a manner that ensures detainees secure jobs shortly after leaving the camp in roles that take into account their “employment aspirations and the needs of society”.<a href="#fn512" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref512" role="doc-noteref"><sup>512</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite this being described as a voluntary skills training and job placement programme, some detainees are, in fact, forcibly transferred from internment camps to situations of forced labour, including to factories in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Amnesty International interviewed seven survivors who were forced to do different types of labour in the aftermath of their release from a camp, including three who were sent to work in factories.<a href="#fn513" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref513" role="doc-noteref"><sup>513</sup></a> X were made to work in village administration offices<a href="#fn514" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref514" role="doc-noteref"><sup>514</sup></a> or police stations,<a href="#fn515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref515" role="doc-noteref"><sup>515</sup></a> where they often performed menial tasks.<a href="#fn516" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref516" role="doc-noteref"><sup>516</sup></a> One was made to work on a state-owned farm<a href="#fn517" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref517" role="doc-noteref"><sup>517</sup></a> and one was made to do chores by cadres for a Han Chinese man in the village.<a href="#fn518" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref518" role="doc-noteref"><sup>518</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym E1] told Amnesty that after spending six months<a href="#fn519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref519" role="doc-noteref"><sup>519</sup></a> in one camp he was transferred to another camp, where he was taught to sew in preparation for being sent to a factory. He was then forced to live and work in a factory for several months, making government uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>“During the day [at the second camp] we would sit on a plastic chair. A teacher teaches language and how to make clothes. During the 21 days [we spent in the second camp] we went to class two or three times, otherwise we were just in cell… The teachers from the screen were in [a different] class. They just showed us how to make clothes on the TV. Some guys were there [in this camp] for two years and never touched a machine… Then a list came out for people to transfer to a factory. Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Uzbeks, not Uyghurs… Then I was sent to a factory for five months. To make government uniforms at first. Then we started making dresses. I worked for eight hours a day. I had one hour of exercise in yard… I was allowed to call family and friends, but not people abroad… There was no physical inspection but we were given phones and asked to install a police app… We worked five days a week. The salary was</strong> <strong>1620 RMB a month… We were really ineffective. We didn’t know how to do it. They had some Chinese woman come in for one week to try to teach us.”</strong><a href="#fn520" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref520" role="doc-noteref"><sup>520</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym X10] told Amnesty he spent three months working in an ethnically segregated factory for low pay after being released from the camp:</p>
<p><strong>“[After I was released from the camp] they ordered me not to leave my house for 10 days… After a week they called me back and they registered me, and made a list of people who had been in the camp. Then they gathered all the people on the list and we went to a garment factory. We didn’t have a choice but to go there… The salary was low. It was impossible to take care of my family with the salary. The first month [we were paid]</strong> <strong>200 RMB…</strong> <strong>The factory was on the outskirts of [redacted] county seat. Only ethnic minorities were working in the factory – Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Hui. The [only] Hans were the heads of the factory... The factory made clothes, gloves, and bags.”</strong><a href="#fn521" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref521" role="doc-noteref"><sup>521</sup></a></p>
<p>The three survivors who provided Amnesty with accounts of being sent to work in factories after being released from detention were all ultimately able to leave the factory. This was because of a government policy that allowed factory workers to return to their homes if they had secured another job and if another employer was willing to sign a guarantor letter taking responsibility for them. [Pseudonym X10] was permitted to leave the factory at night because he lived nearby, although other people were required to live there. Every week he had to submit a written report of what he did [to the village administration].</p>
<p><strong>“I was at the factory for three months. After three months I asked if I could do my old profession. They said, ‘okay, but you need to get a letter from your work saying that they are taking responsibility for you and to give the address of the head of your workplace’… I got the paper [signed] and went back to [the place I used to work] after I finished school.”</strong><a href="#fn522" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref522" role="doc-noteref"><sup>522</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym Q1] told Amnesty he worked and lived in a factory for two weeks after being released from a camp. Some other workers in the factory had not been sent from camps; rather, they had been taken to the factory when another member of their family was taken to a camp:</p>
<p><strong>“They took us [to the factory] … there were many buildings and many people… I had to go to third floor… They taught us how to sew clothes. And while we were having lunch I spoke with women and girls [who worked there] and learned that those women’s husband or girls’ father were in camp, that is why they were taken there. I learned that if one family [member] is in camp you have to work so father or husband can get out quickly… I worked there for 12 days…. I had been a businessman before.

<p>After being released from the internment camps, survivors are placed under electronic and in-person surveillance and are subjected to regular evaluations from government cadres. They also face severe restrictions on their rights and freedoms – particularly on their freedom of movement. These restrictions are in addition to the discriminatory policies directed at members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang (see Chapter 1).</p>
<p>Family members of detainees also faced additional restrictions on their rights and freedoms during and after the release of their detained family member.

This evidence includes a directive in the Telegram proscribing that every ex-detainee must be strictly monitored, evaluated, and controlled, and “must not leave the line of sight for one year” after leaving the camp.<a href="#fn537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref537" role="doc-noteref"><sup>537</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="re-education-continues">9.1 ‘Re-education’ continues</h2>
<p>Nearly all former detainees were required to attend classes in language and ideology after they were released.<a href="#fn538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref538" role="doc-noteref"><sup>538</sup></a> Members of ethnic minorities who had never been detained were also often required to attend class; however, former detainees are normally made to go for two or three hours every day and other members of the village were required to go twice a week.<a href="#fn539" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref539" role="doc-noteref"><sup>539</sup></a> Family members of some detainees were also made to go to classes several hours a day.<a href="#fn540" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref540" role="doc-noteref"><sup>540</sup></a> Several ex-detainees reported that after they were released, during the classes they were required to continue to write confession and self-criticism letters and give them to local cadres to evaluate.<a href="#fn541" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref541" role="doc-noteref"><sup>541</sup></a> One survivor reported that Kazakhs and Uyghurs in her village were required to attend separate classes.<a href="#fn542" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref542" role="doc-noteref"><sup>542</sup></a> Han people were not required to attend classes.<a href="#fn543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref543" role="doc-noteref"><sup>543</sup></a></p>
<p>Nearly all ex-internees were required to attend flag-raising ceremonies every Monday morning after they were released.<a href="#fn544" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref544" role="doc-noteref"><sup>544</sup></a> During the ceremony, ex-detainees are often made to publicly confess their crimes,<a href="#fn545" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref545" role="doc-noteref"><sup>545</sup></a> to speak out against extremism, to apologize for being an extremist, and to extol the virtue of the education they had received.<a href="#fn546" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref546" role="doc-noteref"><sup>546</sup></a> Several survivors told Amnesty that only ethnic minorities were required to attend the village flag-raising. According to [Pseudonym M2], members of the village who were not in camps were also required to go, but only ethnic minorities were truly compelled to attend: “Only Uyghurs go. Chinese people, they laugh at us,” she said.<a href="#fn547" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref547" role="doc-noteref"><sup>547</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym 66], who spent more than a year in the camps, was told to write and then read a statement praising the CCP and instructing others not be practice religion at a flag raising shortly after she was released from the camps:</p>
<p><strong>“I was told to say… ‘I [Pseudonym 66] am the daughter of… I have been to a camp… because I made a mistake and now, with thanks to the Party, I have reversed my mistakes… and now I live in the right was thanks to the Party. They put me on the right path.” I also had to say that ‘We shouldn’t be religious, that it is wrong. We shouldn’t pray. We should always follow the party.”</strong></p>
<p>Family members of internees also had to speak at flag-raising ceremonies. [Pseudonym C1] told Amnesty International his brother was made to speak about him at a flag-raising ceremony. “[My brother] had to confess that his brother had ‘disease’ and that he was ashamed and sorry,” he said.<a href="#fn548" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref548" role="doc-noteref"><sup>548</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="government-minders">9.2 Government minders</h2>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 4, one of the most invasive aspects of life in Xinjiang for ex-detainees is the presence of government minders. Many survivors reported that after they were released from a camp, government cadres were required to stay with them in their houses for several nights per month.<a href="#fn549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref549" role="doc-noteref"><sup>549</sup></a></p>
<p>Some reported that cadres checked in on them during the day but did not stay overnight.<a href="#fn550" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref550" role="doc-noteref"><sup>550</sup></a> The cadres took pictures of them and their family, monitored their behaviour, and tried to teach them the correct ideology.<a href="#fn551" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref551" role="doc-noteref"><sup>551</sup></a> Minders also checked the homework from the language and ideology classes.<a href="#fn552" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref552" role="doc-noteref"><sup>552</sup></a> [Pseudonym X12] told Amnesty that minders would come and inspect her house every day to make sure she was home, and they would check her homework from the night school. “If you passed the homework test they leave, or they would stay and help you do work,” she said.<a href="#fn553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref553" role="doc-noteref"><sup>553</sup></a></p>
<p>Several survivors reported that while they were in the camp, their family members were required to have minders stay with them.<a href="#fn554" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref554" role="doc-noteref"><sup>554</sup></a> [Pseudonym X13] told Amnesty International that when her father was sent to a camp, she and her mother were forced to move back to their home village and have a government minder stay with them. She described what the minder did while staying with the family: “She eats with us. Listens to what we are saying. Tells us about politics. About our crimes. For example, [she said] ‘do not go abroad. Do not contact outside world. Be thankful for government. Confess that your father committed crimes.’”<a href="#fn555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref555" role="doc-noteref"><sup>555</sup></a></p>
<p>Similar cadre “home stays” have been widely report by journalists and other organizations.<a href="#fn556" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref556" role="doc-noteref"><sup>556</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="restriction-on-freedom-of-movement">9.3 Restriction on freedom of movement</h2>
<p>All survivors faced significant restrictions on their freedom of movement after they were released from the camp. Nearly all were prohibited from leaving their village or township. If they were allowed to leave they were required to get written permission from the authorities beforehand.<a href="#fn557" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref557" role="doc-noteref"><sup>557</sup></a> Several survivors were put under house arrest for several months. Many were required to check in with the police or village administrators daily.<a href="#fn558" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref558" role="doc-noteref"><sup>558</sup></a> Several were forced to live at the village administration office or police station for a few week or months.<a href="#fn559" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref559" role="doc-noteref"><sup>559</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym D1] told Amnesty how his movements were restricted after he was released: “I spent five months being monitored. I just stayed in village. I couldn’t leave without permission. I had to report to the village [administration] office each morning. I needed permission to leave village from the village chief,” he said.<a href="#fn560" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref560" role="doc-noteref"><sup>560</sup></a></p>
<p>Many survivors reported that for months after they left the camp their ID cards were programmed such that an alarm would sound whenever they travelled through checkpoints or whenever they left their village.<a href="#fn561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref561" role="doc-noteref"><sup>561</sup></a> When IDs triggered an alarm ex-internees were often interrogated about the very same things they were questioned about after their arrest and during their detention.<a href="#fn562" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref562" role="doc-noteref"><sup>562</sup></a> [Pseudonym X11], a woman in her fifties who had been detained for a year for visiting Kazakhstan, told Amnesty International how her movement was restricted after she was released from the camps:</p>
<p><strong>“After I was released… it was house arrest. Every time I scanned my ID it went off… I wasn’t allowed to go to another town. Even in the streets, the camp follows you… Even when I went to buy a meal I had to fill in a form saying I had been to a camp. It was shameful… my daughter was living [in another town] I couldn’t visit her because of this. Can you imagine going into the street and the police surround you every time?”</strong><a href="#fn563" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref563" role="doc-noteref"><sup>563</sup></a></p>
<p>Other survivors told Amnesty their ID was confiscated for a time after their release. “[When I wasn’t in class or at a flag-raising ceremony] I had to stay at home the rest of the time, because the inspector could come at any time. I had to be found in one of these places at all times. My ID was taken. I wasn’t free,” [Pseudonym M1] told Amnesty International.<a href="#fn564" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref564" role="doc-noteref"><sup>564</sup></a></p>
<p>After several months some of the movement restrictions begin to decrease. Many survivors reported that some restrictions were lifted after six months.<a href="#fn565" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref565" role="doc-noteref"><sup>565</sup></a> Several told Amnesty the restrictions on their movements lasted a year.<a href="#fn566" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref566" role="doc-noteref"><sup>566</sup></a> One survivor told Amnesty the restrictions on his movement were removed at the same time as others released when he was.<a href="#fn567" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref567" role="doc-noteref"><sup>567</sup></a></p>
<p>Family members of internees also had severe restrictions placed on them while their family member was in a camp. Several survivors reported that their family members needed to get permission from local officials to leave their village.<a href="#fn568" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref568" role="doc-noteref"><sup>568</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="restrictions-on-leaving-the-country">9.4 Restrictions on leaving the country </h2>
<p>It has been difficult for minorities in Xinjiang to travel abroad for years.<a href="#fn569" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref569" role="doc-noteref"><sup>569</sup></a> The restriction became more severe in 2015 and 2016, when ethnic minorities were required to hand in their passports to authorities.<a href="#fn570" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref570" role="doc-noteref"><sup>570</sup></a> Since 2017, it has been nearly impossible for Uyghurs to leave China.<a href="#fn571" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref571" role="doc-noteref"><sup>571</sup></a> The Uyghurs who have gotten out have ties to foreign countries and have left after international pressure on China or after paying bribes<a href="#fn572" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref572" role="doc-noteref"><sup>572</sup></a> (see Chapter 4).</p>
<p>Kazakhs have also been restricted; however, after the intervention of the Government of Kazakhstan, some Kazakhs with Kazakhstan citizenship or strong family ties to Kazakhstan have been able to leave China. Before leaving, people must go through a labyrinthine bureaucratic process to get their passports back and to secure permission to go abroad.<a href="#fn573" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref573" role="doc-noteref"><sup>573</sup></a> Ex-detainees face a further round of interrogations by security personnel and must sign additional documents stating they will not say anything about being in a camp or their family members will be sent to a camp.</p>
<p>Several detainees were forced to give video testimonies before leaving the country. [Pseudonym], who spent several months trying to secure permission to travel to Kazakhstan, told Amnesty International he was forced to make a video extolling the benefits of the education he received in the camp before he was allowed to leave.</p>
<p><strong>“One week [after I got my passport back], people from police called me again. Then they took my passport again and said they would keep it until a county-level official signed [the form]. And then they gave me a piece of paper to sign saying I would not disclose anything about the camp or the secrets of the People’s Republic of China, and I signed it. I made an oath that I would not disclose… After I signed, three or four cadres came to my house. They came with cameras. Before they started filming me they told me what to say – that I went to school and that I got knowledge and that I was happy with the government and with the opportunity to gain knowledge… In front of the camera I said that the Party is taking good care of me and that the government is helping the poor people… and that during the seven or eight months of my school the teacher and others were friendly and that they taught me well… I was instructed to say this so I said it. They saved the tape. They repeated to me not to say anything bad. Then I signed the paper where I said I would. Then they gave me my passport back. [Then I left the country].”</strong></p>
<p>[Pseudonym] told Amnesty he was interrogated several times while trying to get passports for his family to go to Kazakhstan. He was repeatedly told by security officials that he could not talk about what happened in the camps and that he had to swear on video that he would never disclose anything about the situation. His parents were also required to sign guarantor letters. “My parents had to say, ‘I do give my consent and I will be taken to a camp if my son ever speaks to foreign media and discloses what happened in camp’,”<a href="#fn574" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref574" role="doc-noteref"><sup>574</sup></a> he told Amnesty International. Several months later his family was given their passports.</p>
<p>Many camp survivors told Amnesty International that regaining their freedom of movement – to travel abroad and, in some cases, to travel within China outside of their home village – was contingent upon having one or more guarantors who agreed in writing that they would be sent to a camp if the person they were guaranteeing spoke or shared information about the internment camp system.<a href="#fn575" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref575" role="doc-noteref"><sup>575</sup></a> One older woman needed many guarantors to leave.<a href="#fn576" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref576" role="doc-noteref"><sup>576</sup></a><a href="#fn577" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref577" role="doc-noteref"><sup>577</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="survivors-abroad-harassed-families-punished">9.5 Survivors abroad harassed, families punished</h2>
<p>Survivors who manage to go aboard are often threatened if they do not return on time.<a href="#fn578" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref578" role="doc-noteref"><sup>578</sup></a> Several survivors reported that government officials called them and threatened to send their family members to camps if they did not return or if they spoke out. [Pseudonym] told Amnesty that when he left Xinjiang he was told he would be sent to a camp if he did not return on time. When he did not return on time, police called him and said they would take his father and father-in-law to a camp if he did not return.<a href="#fn579" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref579" role="doc-noteref"><sup>579</sup></a></p>
<p>Several survivors were called by family members in Xinjiang – who were in the presence of government officials – asking them to return and saying that if they did not, the family member would be sent to a camp. [Pseudonym] told Amnesty that police called him with his son, and his son said he was going to be detained if the man did not return.<a href="#fn580" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref580" role="doc-noteref"><sup>580</sup></a> Survivors told Amnesty they believe their family members were sent to a camp because they left the country.<a href="#fn581" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref581" role="doc-noteref"><sup>581</sup></a></p>
<p>[Pseudonym] told Amnesty she was continually harassed by officials after she arrived in Kazakhstan. “Once I came to Kazakhstan, I thought I was free… But [government officials] kept calling.

<h1 id="crimes-against-humanity">10. Crimes Against Humanity</h1>
<p>Crimes against humanity are particularly a heinous type of serious crimes. They are prohibited actions committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy. They are prohibited during war or peace.<a href="#fn583" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref583" role="doc-noteref"><sup>583</sup></a> The Rome Statute – the treaty that established the International Criminal Court – contains articles that define Crimes Against of Humanity that are now customary international law; that is, they are binding on all states, regardless of whether or not a state is party to the Statute.<a href="#fn584" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref584" role="doc-noteref"><sup>584</sup></a></p>
<p>The contextual elements of crimes against humanity require that each individual act be perpetrated in the context of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population and with knowledge of the attack. “Attack directed against any civilian population” is defined in Article 7(2)(a) of the Rome Statute as “a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy to commit such attack.”<a href="#fn585" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref585" role="doc-noteref"><sup>585</sup></a></p>
<p>Such attack does not need to be both widespread and systematic. “Widespread” is determined by the number of victims or magnitude of the acts.<a href="#fn586" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref586" role="doc-noteref"><sup>586</sup></a> “Systematic” has been held to “signif[y] the organised nature of the acts of violence and the improbability of their random occurrence.”<a href="#fn587" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref587" role="doc-noteref"><sup>587</sup></a> Courts have commonly held the “systematic” threshold to be met when there is a “[p]atterns of crimes—that is the nonaccidental repetition of similar criminal conduct on a regular basis.”<a href="#fn588" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref588" role="doc-noteref"><sup>588</sup></a> The presence of each of these requirements must be proved before any accused person can be convicted of crimes against humanity. Moreover, individual culpability for crimes against humanity requires that the perpetrator have a certain degree of knowledge about the crime. Notably, perpetrators must have knowledge of the fact that their actions were part of a widespread or systematic attack.<a href="#fn589" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref589" role="doc-noteref"><sup>589</sup></a> However, an individual does not need to be personally responsible for widespread or systematic attacks to be found guilty; a single act can be sufficient if and only if it was carried out in the context of a broader attack of which the perpetrator was aware.<a href="#fn590" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref590" role="doc-noteref"><sup>590</sup></a></p>
<p>Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) enumerates twelve crimes against humanity: Murder; Extermination; Enslavement; Deportation or forcible transfer of population; Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; Torture; Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; Persecution against any identifiable group or collectively on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; Enforced disappearance of persons; The crime of apartheid; Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.<a href="#fn591" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref591" role="doc-noteref"><sup>591</sup></a></p>
<p>Under international law, states may, and in some cases must, exercise universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.<a href="#fn592" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref592" role="doc-noteref"><sup>592</sup></a> Any state may, under customary international law, undertake one of the following actions against suspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity, even where the suspects are neither nationals nor residents of the state concerned, and the crime(s) did not take place in its territory: bring such persons before its own courts; extradite such persons to any state party willing to do so; or surrender such persons to an international criminal court with jurisdiction to try persons for these crimes. Regarding certain crimes described in this report, in particular torture, exercising universal jurisdiction over perpetrators is a legal obligation, not a choice.<a href="#fn593" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref593" role="doc-noteref"><sup>593</sup></a></p>
<p>[Insert number] of members of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been the victims of the government’s widespread and systematic attack in furtherance of a state policy – in this case as part of the Chinese government’s campaigns to eradicate “terrorism, extremism, and separatism” and to forcibly assimilate ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Specifically, Amnesty International has concluded that the contextual elements have been met for the the following five crimes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law, including through the arbitrary detention of one million or more men and women in internment camps throughout Xinjiang.</p></li>
<li><p>Torture, including the physical torture of a significant portion of the internment camp population by beatings, electric shocks, stress position, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, and solitary confinement. And the physical and non-physical torture of all internment camp detainees as a result of the cumulative effects of daily life in the camps. This includes being made to sit, kneel, or stand in stress positions for hours every day; sleep deprivation; and insufficient food, water, exercise, and exposure to natural light. It also includes various forms of psychological abuse, including not knowing when their detention will end, not being able to communicate with their family or anyone outside the camp, not being able to speak in their native tongue, living under the constant threat of violence, and being made to see and hear other detainees being tortured or otherwise ill-treated.</p></li>
<li><p>Persecution based on ethnic and religious grounds, including through the ethnically-targeted campaign of arbitrary detention, the restriction on freedom to practice Islam, and restriction on freedom of movement for ethnic minorities.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforced disappearance of persons, including by the detention of [insert number] of people who the government refuses to give information on about their fate or whereabouts with their families and other concerned parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The survivor testimonies Amnesty International has gathered form the basis of these conclusions; however, these testimonies are corroborated by leaked government documents and other credible testimonial, photographic, and documentary evidence collected by journalists and investigators. Taken together, this evidence clearly illustrates that the serious abuses documented in this report follow a very consistent pattern of criminal conduct and are part of well-documented government policy that is knowingly and purposefully being carried out on a massive scale by government officials all over Xinjiang. As a result, an independent, impartial, and effective criminal investigation is needed to establish individual responsibility for these crimes.</p>

It covers the period from the moment the person is placed under restraint up to the time the individual is brought before a competent authority that orders release or continued custody; The term detention is used to describe when a person has been deprived of his or her liberty by a state authority (or with the state’s consent or acquiescence) for any reason other than being convicted of an offence.

Between 2014 and 2017, Xinjiang authorities sent 200,000 cadres from government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and public institutions to be stationed in villages, regularly visit and surveil people, and subject them to political propaganda, a scheme that has been extended indefinitely.16 In October 2016, authorities initiated a related effort, called the “Becoming Family” (㔃ሩ䇔Ӣ) campaign. Since December 2017, this “Becoming Family” campaign has been expanded as a compulsory homestay programme where more than a million cadres spend at least five days every two months in the homes of Xinjiang residents primarily in the countryside.17 16 “200,000 Communist Party members Dispatched to Stay in Grassroots Villages in Xinjiang to Visit the People, Benefit the People, and Get Together the Hearts of the People (ᯠ⮶ 20 зᵪޣᒢ䜘лสቲտзᶁˈ䇯≁ᛵǃᜐ≁⭏ǃ㚊≁ᗳ),” People Online (Ӫ≁㖁, http://xj.people.com.cn/GB/188750/361873/ (accessed August 14, 2018). 17 “China: Visiting Officials Occupy Homes in Muslim Region,” Human Rights Watch news release, May 13, 2018, https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/13/china-visiting-officials-occupy-homes-muslim-region.<a href="#fnref556" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
